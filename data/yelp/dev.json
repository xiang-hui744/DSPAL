{"_id": 2, "text": "Okay. Glad there are other reviews posted for White Rabbit Fusion Cafe already. I been holding off on posting a review for it since it, well it did not exactly wow the F out of me. And 3 stars is the best they can get out of me with their soft opening effort.\\n\\nBut first let me just explain what White Rabbit Fusion Cafe is to those not familiar with this food truck from California turned brick and mortar LV restaurant.  It is Filipino comfort/street food proteins (Chicken Adobo, Pork Sisig, Pork Longanisa, etcetera.) packaged in traditional Mexican food delivery vessels (i.e., your tacos, burritos, quesadilla).\\n\\nThe portion is just underwhelming for me, but I can pack a lot of food away, so I am biased.  But they have Tofu on the menu for vegetarians.  The concept of someone  ordering something vegetarian at a Filipino Fusion place is just so foreign to me.  But it is available.\\n\\nPricing seems high to me for what you get.  The fact that it is in or near one of the busier plazas in the \\\"Chinatown District\\\" makes their pricing strategy suspect.  If it was something served from a food truck at FoodieFest,I can see the reasoning behind the carnival-like pricing, but not such a great incentive from a brick and mortar operation.  I know, it does not make sense, but I stand by my opinion.\\n\\nThe cashier, even though this was her first job ever, was nice.  The order was prepared quickly and correctly, which is expected but still nice.  My Pork Sisig Burrito had a good ratio of pork sisig to rice ratio, but was on the dried side.  Portion seems to be designed for a growing 5 year old or someone on a weight loss plan.\\n\\nStill just a 3 star-ish experience overall for me. But I will chalk it up to their Pork Sisig not being as good as I had expect it to be, and give them another chance trying something else from their menu on a future visit."}

I'm a pretty adventurous eater, so I told them to throw the best of the bunch at me. He suggested the Uzbak Pulao, which was grilled lamb on top of a rice mixture (carrots, currants, and bits of meat...I'm assuming it was lamb or goat). My husband ordered the Chicken Handi, which was grilled chicken with a spicy rub over rice (nothing fancy here).  We also ordered Naan and a side of hummus.\\n\\nWe got home and dove into our meals, which by the way, was enough to feed a family of four, if not six. My lamb was chewy (I ordered it medium rare) with very little flavor, and the rice mixture was bland and oily (probably from all the meat). The Naan had no flavor at all, either, and after a certain point, I felt like I was eating a chewy piece of cardboard. By far the worst of the bunch was the hummus. It was literally mashed up chickpeas with no additional ingredients (tahini, anyone? Maybe a little lemon juice?). It was bland as can be.  To be fair, my husband enjoyed his chicken, but it doesn't take a lot to please his palate. I also tried his rice, and it was nothing special. \\n\\nWhile this place is a killer value and and a sweet family run establishment, we, sadly, won't be returning."}

Dang burger was salty as heck. The Haystack Onions were too. I would have let it slide if it were just me. My coworkers, however, said the same thing. It took the three of us to finish the haystack onions because I could not have more than just a bit of that oversalted mess. Service was pretty sucky too.

It is kind of hit and miss with the slices when you go in. I am guessing because they are usually sitting there and you have to reheat them etc. When we order delivery the pies are great, hot, cheesy with fresh toppings. So I would say if you are in their range for delivery then by all means do so or pick up a pie. They can keep the slices. The salads are OK. I think they should invest in better dressing. They use the  cheap store brought stuff and you can definitely tell. J and J upgrade to better dressing. \\n\\nThe place seems to be run my a bunch of teenagers. I never see anyone in there older than 22 or so. But I have to say they are always attentive, cheerful and get your food out to you ASAP.

As per the menu, happy hour is everyday from 2-7p. \\n\\nWe ordered the beer sampler, my husband ordered the Onion Burger and I ordered the East Valley Burger. (both medium well) and mac & cheese with fries for our kiddo. Beer came and it was good, the waiter didn't really explain much of the beers, nor the seasonal, he just gave us the paper that goes with the sampler that describes the beers. They were a good size for samplers, enough for both of us to taste and have more than 4 sips each. Our son's food came, with apple slices instead of  the fries we order; the waiter came back apologetic with the fries (FYI- the restaurant has no kiddie cups or to go cups for the kids drinks, just big, glass cups. Def not kid friendly). \\n\\nOur burgers came, both burgers were beyond well done, mind you we ordered them medium; we let the waiter know, but at this point we had already bitten into our flavorless burgers. Did I mention flavorless? Yes, they were; there was no seasoning whatsoever on them, they tasted like regular cooked ground beed. The onion burger claims it has horseradish cream sauce...there was less than a sliver on the burger; meanwhile the East Valley burger is described as having a cilantro lime sour cream...again a sliver, we could barely taste it. After our son was done eating, we asked for his ice cream, as it's part of his meal. The ice cream tasted like it has been sitting in the freezer for months and months. You know the kind, where there's freezer burn on your ice cream but you eat it anyway because you just have to have it...yeah that kind. Our son, who LOVES ice cream, didn't even eat it. \\n\\nWe then asked for our check; upon reviewing it, I noticed that we had been charged the regular price for the sampler. I asked the waiter and he said that it wasn't happy hour, so I pulled out the beer menu where it clearly states: HAPPY HOUR EVERYDAY 2-7p (and then the bottom describes what the specials are); he then went to the manager and comped (is that even a word?) , whatever, he reduced the price of the beer sampler. \\n\\nWould we return? Maybe for their beers and possibly appetizers.  The service, beer selection and location is good, food...eh I've had better.

Day.\\n\\nBecause i'm addicted, I had to go with a benny option, though the waffles here look pretty killer as well. Opted for a Eggs Royale (smoked salmon benny) and it was darn tasty. Alongside not one, but two coffees (you know it's good when this rare coffee consumer orders a second), it was a lovely little brunch for a decent price.\\n\\nI had been in here once previously for a smoothie. Honestly, they aren't my favourite but I come from the land of smack-you-in-the-face-green-health-smoothies, so it was just too sweet for my likely. That being said, in the city, they're second only to Hula in this category. If you are a far less picky guy/gal and like a sweet fruit drink - this is likely a good option.\\n\\nAll in all, another lovely little find for my Sunday afternoons. Thanks Caz!"}
{"_id": 2, "text": "On my weekend visit to Pittsburgh, I quickly learned that Primanti Bros. was a must try.  My first taste was at PNC Park where they have an express version, but I must have had 10 to 20 people tell me that I must also try the original location in the Strip District to get the full experience.  So...at about 2am after a night of bar hopping, I wandered down through the warehouses and found myself in a packed restaurant.  I'd tried the roast beef & cheese at the ballpark and decided to try something different at this location.  I was disappointed when told that there was no more tuna, so I settled on the ham, egg & cheese.  Loaded with slaw and onions, I scarfed this monster sandwich down with ease.  Like the one at the ballpark, I found it to be good, but not great.  For me, the slaw is a bit overpowering and the soft bread makes it a huge mess to eat.  I'd order one again someday, but probably go with the black angus steak & cheese.  According to my last taxi driver, he claims that it's the best."}

If you are not a seafood person this may not be the place for you. King Crab legs and jumbo shrimp cocktails will keep me coming back for more every time.

{"_id": 0, "text": "I should have read the reviews first.  If the reviews are that spread out its obviously \\\"hit or miss\\\".  This was my first and last time going there. It was definitely a giant miss for me.  After being seated and waiting for so long, I was about to just leave when the waiter called out on his way from the next table that he would right there.  After another long wait, he finally showed up. When asked about any of the menu items, he just looked confused.  When ordering a wine with dinner he had to put his finger on the page and leave with the wine list. Of course during this time, we had to specifically ask for water to drink be brought to the table. \\n\\nFor the appetizers, I had the French Onion Soup (not bad), while my companion had the Tomato Salad which consisted three slices of tomato with baby sprigs and a dressing. Hardly enough to be considered a salad. \\n\\nWhen the entrees arrived. They both looked, felt and tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for far too long. My prime rib was cold as well as my \\\"whipped\\\" (mashed) potatoes. My companion had the club sandwich with rosemary pomme frittes (French Fries). Its hard to mess up a club sandwich, but the fries were cold, limp and greasy.  EVERYTHING had to be sent back to the kitchen!  My meal came out a second time and it was correct. My companions pomme frittes came out in the same state as the first attempt. She just gave up and simply said \\\"never mind\\\" to the fries. \\n\\nDuring the course of the meal our drinks ran low and eventually empty. My companion had to go to the hostess stand and ask if the manager could stop by our table with some water. \\n\\nWhen Mark the manager showed up, we conveyed our experiences with Rey the waiter.  He of course politely apologized. And offered to \\\"adjust\\\" the bill, which Rey promptly delivered. Rey seemed to have forgotten the the special I ordered came with dessert, so I had to remind him.  Of course coffee wasn't offered so I had to flag Rey down for som coffee. When we got our coffee, Rey was distracted by something else yet again and just put his carafe on the table in front of me like we were at an Ihop.  Since we ordered coffee, he had to add that to the bill and we had to flag him down yet again. \\n\\nSERVICE: Horrible\\nFOOD:  Mediocre (at best)\\n\\nFor the guy that said \\\"not that bad\\\", I ask you how does it have to be before you feel like your time and money has been wasted?  How important is you time and how hard do you work for you money?  If you value either, you won't waste it at Le Cafe Ile Saint Louis."}

I ordered the veggie burger on a wheat bun, with saut\\u00e9ed onions & mozzarella cheese, it came on Texas toast, no onions & with cheddar cheese. I couldn't even pick up the burger without it falling apart it was so soggy. As for the tuna melt, I ordered it with provolone instead of cheddar, but it still came with cheddar and it was just tuna and cheese slopped on a long piece of white bread, there was not one vegetable on it. Lastly, the fish and chips, they were almost a black color and very greasy, they were not good at all to say the least. Needless to say I will not be ordering from here again, it was a big disappointment as they did not get one thing we ordered correct & the only thing that was good was the waffle fries."}

I know ours popular in this obese children's society to feed kids crap but who the hell feeds their kids macaroni and cheese for dinner? Isn't that a side dish? When did this become a main course from hell? How lazy can a parent be than to serve a kid macaroni and cheese. Oh yeah, order macaroni and cheese. So as it goes we order from the main menu. Chicken with mozzarella sandwich and i had the salmon. It was way too much to pay for frozen meals. The rice was swimming in soy sauce and pineapple. I'm a carb addict and if i can't eat it, its not worth eating. The green beams i have to say were the highlight of the meal. They tasted like the ones at outback which i just love. The salmon, just more frozen fair. Parmesan fries uneatable, sandwich, just not worth it. The ciabatta roll was dry and tasteless.

We were immediately brought chips and salsa.\\n\\nThe chips were very plain, but I kept eating them.  Our bowls of chips were never empty.  We only had one girl taking care of our whole table, but after a couple rounds of refilled sodas she seemed to be getting the hang of it.  We kept her pretty busy but she handled it well.  The kitchen however, had a little difficulty and there was about a 15 minute difference between the time the first person was served and the last person.  Oh well, we all got our food and it was all correct.\\n\\nI ordered the cheese enchilada and chimichanga (a mini one) combination plate.  The beans that came with the dish were sprinkled with cheese and very tasty.  They were surprisingly smooth and buttery, I'm not really picky about the beans.  The enchilada was a big fat disappointment to me because there were onions inside.  I thought it would just have cheese, because everywhere else I have gone and gotten a cheese enchilada it was just plain inside.  The chimichanga was actually really good to my picky palate.  The shredded beef was flavorful and juicy.  It was also covered in cheese, and that is always a good thing in book.  I could also do without the shredded lettuce on my plate.

{"_id": 2, "text": "So first of all - I'll be upfront and admit - I've been to 1.5 classes. Out of 4 (of a block of 6). I'm probably not going back for my last 2. Bristo Yoga does get a 3rd star because I did enjoy the '1' of my 1.5 class, but the rest of it ends in an 'eh'. \\n\\nOn the first day of class, I turn up 20mins early (eager beaver) but due to some seriously poor directions and map, myself and 6 other students end up in the wrong place - turns out there are two St Columba's up by the Castle... and we were at the wrong one. Arriving 20mins late meant a mild rebuke from the teacher, initially offered no changing area (but then suggested that I could creep over to the bathroom), no warm up, a rushed yoga session (I did ask for the teacher to slow down at one point), and I hurt my neck trying to rush a shoulder stand. I walked out feeling stressed and angry... and really not feeling the benefit that normally comes with such a class. After wards, I felt mutinous more than anything and not really in the mood to return. \\n\\nNow, as a gesture, Bristo did offer an apology and a free drop in class. So that was nice. \\n\\nI made myself return for week 2 - that was a very different experience from the first. The session was smoother, the positions more clearly explained, and I didn't walk out in a pissy mood, so I felt in a much more positive position about the class. Hurrah! The only downside was when asked for injuries, I noted I had bad knees only to be brushed off with a comment along the lines of 'oh well, don't we all'. Right, everyone's smashed their legs up in motorcycle accidents? Of course, silly me... I would have preferred possibly a less cursory response.\\n\\nWeek 3 was a washout as I was ill. \\n\\nWeek 4, I had the day off. That meant in order to come to class, I was going to have to travel for a solid hour in order to get there in time. It was, in fact 90 mins, with another 30mins prep time. 2 hours, in total as Lothian Transports estimates were completely messed up. A bus expected to arrive a good clear 30mins early, meant that I arrived instead 30mins late and have hmmm... 5mins to run from George Street, up to Johnson Terrace. I made it to the venue, 3-4mins past the start of the class. When ringing the doorbell, there was no answer. I rang a couple of times, before another girl joined me. After the third, failed attempt, I decided, time to go hit up the pub. For you see, it was my birthday, and I figured, do I want to spend more time being upset outside of a yoga class, or should I just go and enjoy the remainder of my evening? Given that I had given up the opportunity to spend the beginning of my 33rd year with my family in order to go to my yoga class, traveled for so long and to be felled at the last (well, 4) minute, just brought it to a head for me. So I embraced the unhealthy option of a couple of rum and cokes at Banshee Labyrinth waiting for the Silent Reviewer to show up. \\n\\nThe fact that St Columba's is a pain in the ass to access (ring a bell, wait a good 5mins for the teacher to climb a couple of floors to open the door, this may take a few attempts) and the zero tolerance on tardiness leaves me just... disappointed and disheartened. Although I appreciate that late attendees can have a minor impact on a yoga class, in previous experience it hasn't been that big a deal - and until Lothian Transport smarten up their act, I don't feel confident that I can always make it to a location in time. I had heard so many good things about Bristo Yoga, but in reality, I didn't experience the warm and fuzzies when I went to class, week 1 made me feel as unwelcome as rotten fish in a fridge and week 2 whilst an improvement, didn't have me in the land of friendliness.

Shame on me for expecting a good mixed drink at a sushi place but it was like 100 degrees and I just wanted a mojito.\\n\\nThe rolls were pretty solid but we ordered salmon roe w/ a quail egg on top and when it came out, the yolks of the quail egg were solid.  It was really gross.  We sent them back and it took about 30 minutes to get a new batch.  The new batch at least had normal yolks but still tasted a bit funky.  The waitress didn't really ever show any concern even when we told her the second batch was bad.  Instead, she just dropped off our check with the full charge on it.  At that point, we told her that the eggs needed to come off.  She took the check to her manager and came back and took one of three salmon roes off and two of six quail eggs off \\\"since we had eaten some\\\".  Are you freaking kidding me?  We had to eat it to know it was bad!  \\n\\nWe paid for our meal because we just wanted to get out of there but I couldn't let it go so I asked to see the manager.  When the manager came out, she seemed a bit concerned and offered to refund the rest of the eggs/roe.

They did have an extensive menu with some authentic dishes.  I am only one guy so I tried a combo plate for a little variety.  The Chile rellano was actually pretty decent, not quite homemade, but very good.  The other diners in my group were all very happy with their food.  The entire meal was well prepared.\\n\\nTHE SERVICE\\n\\nI think this is what seperates this place.  The service is very good.  It is fast with out anyone trying to hurry you up.  Plenty of refills and they remove plates, bottles, ect... promptly.  There seemed to be a sincere welcome felling - as if you went to persons home...\\n\\nTHE VENUE\\n\\nThis place has been in the same spot for some time.  It has a bar with 3 seperate dining areas.  It is plenty big enough.  It had a charm to it - they didn't over do it or try to hard.  Very homey.  The place appeared to be very clean too.  \\n\\nTHE INTANGIBLES\\n\\nThe restaurant was jam packed full of Mexicans.  I was even dining with Mexicans.  My logic is if the Mexicans like it then it must be good.  Not that they are culinary experts but they do know something about mexican food.  The place just has a good vibe to it.  It feels like a mexican restaurant.  Also, It is locally owned and operated."}

Let me offer a comparison with the Harvest Moon Grille. Appetizers at Halcyon were excellent in flavor, but $14??? THAT is an expensive app. I had the Ribeye Spackle, which was the outer rim of the Ribeye, folded and stuffed with veggies and cheese. Very good, but waiter asked how I wanted it cooked, and I said \\\"however the chef recommends.\\\" I wasn't expecting medium well/well done! I don't know, maybe it was an abberation. Again, flavors were there but execution was not quite what I expected. Desserts were good, but awfully expensive for what you got.

Taste isn't quite as delicious as the smell though, but I did appreciate that the dish was served on a bed of rice and with a drink (though they didn't give me mine). Beef itself is on the dry side, but it's a saucy dish so it did not ruin the meal.\\nThe chicken shwarma salad is decent: moist chicken and fresh veggies, but a bit too much rice for my liking turned it into more of a bowl. Tahini dressing was on the bland side and slightly chalky. They charge 50 cents to add a tablespoon of feta to your dish- and they literally measure out it with a spoon, which is bizarre and stingy to me.\\n\\nI wouldn't hurry to rush back, largely because of their lack of transparency with billing, but there are so many other places that do Mediterranean in Vegas that I'd rather try another.

Easy and to find your way around and quick elevators up to your room (they're divided up, so my 26th floor room elevator was for floors 25-30, plus the spa and ballroom floors). The hotel itself is not flashy like the ones surrounding it, but it's still very nice and made me feel comfortable. \\n\\nRoom: I loved the room! Clean, luxurious, and very functional. The beds were amazing and left me ready and energized the next day following 2 long nights out. Bonuses included was a small refrigerator (no minibar crap inside), safe, a lot of counter space, and an ironing board/iron. The bathroom was contemporary and luxurious as well, featuring a makeup mirror, a well-built bath tub, and toiletries from their in-house spa.\\n\\nGambling: Came up $25 on 5cent slots! hahaha\\n\\nFood: Ate at the TI buffet. Middle of the road, but hey, with a free pass or the included 2-for-1 it's worth a quick meal. Did not get a chance to check out the other places. My girlfriend ordered a drink from the Starbucks inside the hotel - skip this one and try the one on the strip instead.\\n\\nAmenities: Did not take advantage of these aside from the wi-fi, unfortunately. If I had more time I would have liked to check out the fitness center. The Sirens of TI did not interest me (The Yelp gods warned me it was not worth my time).\\n\\nCheck out: Fast and easy via TV. Late check out was granted to me so that was cool.\\n\\nOverall: I had a wonderful time at TI. I got a tremendous deal but my stay was so good that I would not hesitate to stay here again even if I had to pay a little more. The comfortable rooms were just what I was looking for and its location on the strip should make for quite an appeal to those who want to go out and have someplace nice to come back to. \\n\\nI will be coming back here in the future, hopefully to catch Mystere. My trip to TI was definitely one to be treasured. Great value, great rooms, great location, and a very pleasant stay. 4/5."}

The bar area is dark enough to sit at and feel relaxed and comfy with a slight feeling of sophistication.  Also, the booths give me a feeling of privacy which is nice for having conversations with friends.  Everyone that I know loves this place and has always recommended it to me so when I finally tried the food, I was pleased.  Although, I might add, the pasty's are kind of heavy as they tend to be meat, potato, gravy, and pastry based so it's not a food meant for light eating in the summer heat.  Good food, reasonable rates, and good drinks.  Eat there."}

However this was one of our waiters recommendations, so I ordered it with a side of Mac n cheese. The short ribs were off the bone and so tender that a knife was not required.

So, it was an OK choice on occasional nights when we didn't feel like cooking or just wanted a change of scenery.\\n\\nThat is, until last night. After first waiting for 15 minutes for any wait staff to appear, then waiting an additional several minutes for our waters to arrive (not to mention the additional 10 minutes for the single beer to brought out), then waiting for quite some time for our meals to arrive, we discovered that somehow 1 order wasn't placed. At this point it was a full hour from when we were seated. I waited an additional 10-15 minutes for my salad to arrive. The manager stopped by to offer chips and salsa, but we'd already had an app with the 2 for $20, so we declined.\\n\\nAt this point, the kids were tired and restless, and ready to head home. I packed my salad in a to go box and asked for the check. They offered a 10% discount, which amounted to less than $3 on the total bill. Unfortunately, at this point we discovered that the restaurant had stopped the kids eat free plan as well. \\n\\nSo, all told, the meal took twice as long as we planned, with a lot more hassle than necessary, and we spent more than the quality of food warranted, and certainly more than the overall experience warranted.\\n\\nSince the primary reasons we chose Applebee's on nights like last night were the convenience and relative cheap cost, we won't bother going back in the future."}

I'm from Leith and I remember the glory days of this place when it set the example not only to the growing Shore scene but also that of pubs doing good good food all over town!... I've had my best ever fishnchips, best ever smoked haddock risotto, and many great girly lunches here over the years. But years ago, not recently. \\n\\nI came in about 2 months ago with a hangover for a decent Bloody Mary and decided food would be ok. But the battered fish was sswiimmmiinnng in fat and i could barely scrape the tiny bits of fish off of the horribly burned batter. Put it down to a bad day.\\n\\nThis time we were very surprised to get a table at all as it was a v sunny night at 7.30pm  and the shore was very very busy. But we did, which now I know speaks volumes. The hot smoked salmon starter was a massive plate of salad leaves, giant chunks of very smoked salmon, an egg and 2 half stalks of asparagus. Not terrible but totally over saladed and inderseasoned, and far too large.\\n\\nFor mains we had a salmon  risotto, which turned out to be savoury rice pudding with a salmon fillet plonked on top! Totally horrible. If your chef can't do risotto, don't offer it on the menu, The other was a scallop, crevette and squid salad main. First off the chips were forgotten and i had to go chase them, but when they were eventually brought they were barely cooked. The scallops tasted of NOTHING and the crevettes, although covered in herbs of some kind, tasted of nothing. The squid the same. This was a salad that was charged at more the double of the starter size version due to the addition of chips, apparently....the forgotten chips i had to chase that eventually arrived totally undercooked..\\n\\nTo be fair, the waitress seemed keen to know why we hadn't eaten anything, but my dining partner had decided we wouldn't cause a fuss or scene. I still told her I'd not all enjoyed my main and that the late chips were totally underdone and generally i'd not had an enjoyable meal. We asked for the bill. She offered us a free coffee. and then ignored us for ages. Eventually we got to pay and leave. A full bill with nothing taken off.\\n\\nSomeone in that kitchen, in control of it, can not cook and does not care. Someone somewhere along the line between kitchen and customer does not care about customer service. End of story.\\n\\nWe won't be back, ever."}

Also, I used to work at the UWHC and would go to lunch with coworkers there sometimes.\\n\\nI like that La Brioche is attractive. Their decorating style is cute and reminds me of an eccentric old lady's house. The hot pink wallpaper on the back wall is the bomb. I also like how the egg dishes come with mixed greens on the side instead of carbs. \\n\\nHere is what I don't like about La Brioche: \\n\\n-It's EXPENSIVE. Last time I was there a couple months ago, I took a new employee out for lunch. We both drank water and ordered a sandwich each. The sandwiches come with green salad on the side. My sandwich (a BLT) in particular, was tiny. It was more like the size of a half-sandwich from a place like Panera. The bill came to something like $30 dollars with tip. I thought this was ridiculous, and I didn't think the service, food, or atmosphere warranted that price.\\n\\n-The eggs are bland. At least, the times that I've had omelets and such there, the dishes contained little flavor, and were in desperate need of some salt. I'm also pretty sure based on flavor (or lack thereof) that they use non-stick spray to cook eggs as opposed to using butter. This is a cardinal sin in my book. Butter is not to be feared, but embraced!\\n\\n-The service is friendly, but SLOOOOW. The aforementioned lunch with my department's new employee took over an hour from the time we ordered to the time we got our bill. For two sandwiches. Nothing even had to be cooked! This is not good if they hope to appeal to people on limited-time lunch breaks.\\n\\n-Finally, and this is picky, I'll admit, but it really rubs me the wrong way that they have signs up on the wall (and a note in the menu)  that prohibit the use of laptops and cell phones. I get that they want the place to retain an elegant vibe, but at the same time, it irks me, as a functional adult, to be told what I \\\"should\\\" do, especially in such a passive-aggressive manner. Also, La Brioche, if you're going to take over an hour to bring people their bill from lunch during a workday, they will probably have to check their email at some point to avoid getting fired, and thus being unemployed and unable to eat at your expensive restaurant.\\n\\nOverall, I guess I'd give La Brioche 3 stars, but that's being extremely charitable.\\nWhile  I've never had an appalling experience here, I've NEVER been wowed, and I've definitely been annoyed on several occasions.\\n\\nThe breakdown:\\nTaste of food: 2.5 stars\\nLocation: 3 stars\\nService: 3 stars\\nValue: 2 stars"}

Not a big deal in the end, but it's more of a hassle than not drinking anything at all throughout the show.\\n\\nThe entrance is still kind of bizarre to me. They built that ramp down to the nearest exterior door but don't utilize it as the main entrance. You still have to walk through The Saloon, get dirty looks from the bar staff, and then walk down the stairs. Meh. I'm not too thrilled about it.\\n\\nAt the end of the night, it's a killer comedy club. Hiccups are minor and don't detract from the evening that is yet to be had. Don't sweat it. I'm really looking forward to coming back for another show soon. More improve, please!"}

I found out about this place from a friend and I was especially pleased to find them on restaurant.com. So my husband and I printed our $50 gift certificate and headed out on a Friday night. I started the meal with the best cosmo I have ever had, it was definitely strong but I didn't taste any alcohol. The bartender is masterful! I then moved on to the bread basket on the table. The regular bread was delicious and warm. There was also an herb, almost pizza looking bread that I was not very fond of, but I am sure somebody enjoys it. I did notice that other tables were getting bruschetta as well as bread, but I got the feeling they were \\\"regulars,\\\" but it made me feel left out! We moved on to appetizers. I had the caprese salad, which has roasted peppers and onions on it. I was surprised how well the whole thing worked, given its non-traditional nature. I would definitely recommend it! For the main courses, I had the papardelle with filet and my husband had the trout special. The pasta was delightful and the filet was melt in your mouth delicious, but the dish was missing something. It was earthy and rustic but there was a flavor profile missing for sure. The trout was well cooked, but the skin of the fish was not at all crispy and we felt it should have been. It came with a side of pasta that was delicious! Since we had the restaurant.com coupon we decided to go all out and get a dessert. We decided to go out on a limb and try the Sicilian cannoli. The cannoli was almost inedible. It has an overwhelming lemon flavor and is just very off-putting texturally. \\n\\nThe service was wonderful, until the end of the meal. The restaurant had filled up very fast and people were asking to be seated in our server's section. The poor man was running from table to table! It took us over 15 minutes to get someone to swipe our credit card so we could leave, but other than that small ordeal the service was impeccable. Overall, it was a mixed bag for us. I have had better Italian food in Las Vegas, but I may give this another try sometime in the future."}

We got one of the 'combo meals' of burger + regular fries + shake, and a side of sweet potato fries and another shake (malibu/ pineapple/ something for her, espresso/ kahlua for me).  This was plenty of food for two people, and saved a bit of money that we could later spend on the slots.  The sweet potato fries were much better than the regular, and the burger was properly juicy with a nice, soft bun.  Nothing super special, but still good.\\n\\nThe shakes were the highlight.  They were thick, rich, and topped with plenty of whipped cream.  I wish the straw had a slightly larger diameter, but that's a tiny criticism.  There was some vigorous sucking involved in getting all that goodness up the tiny little straw.\\n\\nService was good, water service was reasonable, price was what you'd expect from Vegas, and shakes get the place to about a 3.5, and I'll round up for the happiness that I had from getting off that plane and into a nice, comfy booth."}

We were tired from our six hour drive, so we opted to have a rollaway bed brought up instead of going downstairs to switch rooms. Bad idea, my daughter ended up getting lice! We know it was the rollaway bc my husband, two little boys and I slept on the king bed and we didn't get lice. We asked twice for our room to get cleaned and it never did.

When I was a student at ASU I walked past House of Tricks on my way from Campus to Mill Ave countless times, and I always thought it was out of place.  While even as a student I could appreciate the beauty of a house converted into a restaurant with an amazing garden patio as its setting, it just seemed odd that a such a fancy restaurant was hidden on small street, just feet from a college campus, surrounded by parking meters and pay lots.  Now that I have eaten at House of Ticks, I understand its charm.\\n\\nA while back, my girlfriend mentioned that she had a great happy hour at at this place  with friends some years ago.  She couldn't remember the name, but based on her description I instantly knew she was talking about House of Tricks.  So, when we went to see \\\"Wicked\\\" at Gammage (great show, by the way) for her birthday, I decided it would be the perfect place to dine before seeing the show.  Turns out that's what a lot of people do.  The server even asked if we were heading to the show, so he knew to get us out with time to spear.  We also happened to overhear another server mentioned that about 90% of their customers on a given night were heading over to Gammage.\\n\\nThe food is quite pricy, but very tasty.  I had the Ancho Chili Seared Ahi.  The orange-chipotle honey aioli had a good kick.  The white bean chili had a unique taste.  The tuna it self was perfectly seared, but no too flavorful.  My girlfriend had a salmon dish which was amazing.  The salmon was very flavorful and cooked perfectly.  For dessert (we were celebrating a birthday, after all) we tried a brioche bread pudding.

I told him I needed a good vacuuming (dog hair in the back seat, some in the front) and the interior windows (from kids hand prints). I noticed that it was quite empty as I'm used to being behind several cars, especially on a Saturday around 2 and it being a nice day. I noticed several lanes were empty and I pulled up in lane 4 and was the first car. Normally I block out at least 2 hours for a car wash because I have NEVER been out of there in under an hour and a half. I do not mind waiting since I have never had a problem and my car has always looked \\\"fabulous\\\" afterward. Me, my husband and 2 kids brought books and workbooks to keep us busy for the wait. No kidding... I didn't even get halfway through a chapter in my Game of Thrones book before I hear \\\"Fabulous Lindsay your car is ready!\\\" I look at my phone and notice it's only been 10 minutes. I then glance around the room to make sure it's the right \\\"Fabulous Lindsay\\\". Ok.... no one else here ... must be me.... pack up everything and head to this (what I thought was going to be.... time travel to a 10 minute amazingness fabulousness car washing) As soon as I look inside I knew this was a less than fabulous job.... I could still see dog hair everywhere, as in I'm pretty sure the vaccuum was never even turned on....... I mean it was EVERYWHERE!!! I asked the guy if he could go over it again because there are CLUMPS..... CLUMPS!!! My husband is grabbing it out with his hands and just dropping it on the ground at this point. The guy looks at me and says \\\"no......\\\" I then respond with \\\"seriously?\\\" he then said \\\"You can pay $40 and they can shampoo it and vacuum for you\\\"..... uhhhhh I just purchased the Freddy Special for 24.99 + Wheel Bling, which INCLUDES vacuuming and this guy wants me to pay twice for vacuuming?! Am I being punked? At this point I'm beyond frustrated, I hand him a tip anyway (in hindsight I'm punching myself for this) and leave. As soon as I get home I take pictures of my still dirty car and proceed to pout. Posted 7 pictures of this ridiculousness...."}

Firstly, I want to make it clear that our waitress was very nice and accommodating, so the service gets 5 stars. However. Upon arriving, I ordered a Long Island and my man ordered a dirty martini. I'm not that picky when it comes to drinks, but the Long Island came VERY watered down. It tasted like water and Splenda. I asked the waitress to switch it out for a glass of wine which they didn't have, so I settled for a rum and coke which was also watered down. At this point I gave up. \\nMy boyfriends dirty martini came without olives. He went to the bar to ask for olives and the male and female bartender ignored him for at least two minutes because they were too busy chatting with each other. He moved to another side of the bar and another server or bartender helped him out and added olives to his beverage. \\nThe food we ordered was sub par. His fish and chips were below average, and my nachos were just soggy beyond the first layer of a few chips, and the chicken was bland. \\nOverall, I just can't recommend this restaurant knowing that the food and drinks were almost ok awful level. Maybe if we hear that they've made major changes to their kitchen and bar we'll head back and give them another chance."}

{"_id": 0, "text": "Went here as a choice of the in-laws. Hadn't been to a Macaroni Grill in a few years, and was actually looking forward to it as my past experiences (although never at this location) were very good. When we were seated they tried to put us in the first table just outside of the main path back to the kitchen, even though the place was practically empty (it was a Tues evening). When we asked to move out of the main traffic area, they offered a table one spot away from the original one. OK, we'll play your silly game, let's not address the 800 lb gorilla in the room (the 85% empty restaurant). Once seated our server stopped by very quickly to get drink orders and apps.  Before the app came out, our server was back to take our dinner order (so far, so good, right? Ahhhh, just wait). We ordered: Lasagna w/side salad, Capellini with meat sauce, Eggplant Parmesan  with a side of sausage, and a Parmesan Crusted Chicken Salad.  The side salad came out not long after the app, and then the wait began. Not sure how long, but it was long enough for the entire table to get antsy and for us to ask for more bread. We even joked that it was because someone ordered lasagna.  When the main courses came out, take a guess which one didn't come out with them...you ready? The Parmesan Crusted Chicken Salad. Seriously. The rest of the table started eating (it can't be that far behind, right?) and no kidding, they were at least halfway through their main course when they brought out a salad with what looked like a half of a chicken tender chopped up in it. I thought maybe they had tossed it in or something, and when I confirmed the few small pieces were all that was there, it went from not so good to bad (and soon to really bad...wait for it...).\\n\\nSo, here I sat with this sad salad with a couple pieces of chicken, and because the wait had been so long, I was done. I told the server I didn't want it anymore and to send it back. Then I told her to make sure her manager saw what was coming out of the kitchen. I saw her talk to the manager and she came back and said they were going to make some more chicken. I told her that I didn't want it at all. I saw her go talk to the manager, who was at this point standing in front of the girl making salads) and I know by her body language and his that she told him I didn't want it at all. A few minutes later I saw them put more chicken on the salad, put some more dressing on it, and he started walking over. When he got to the table I was PISSED (yeah, really). I asked him what part of \\\"I don't want it\\\" did he not understand and he just stood there hovering over me with this damn salad in his hands. I explained everything that had happened and he told me that the server never told him that I didn't want it at all. He asked if there was anything he could do and I said \\\"Yes, you can go away\\\" (he was still just standing there staring at me like he could use the Force to make me take the salad.\\n\\nNow, you might be thinking, \\\"Damn, little harsh Bro!\\\" Ah yeah, but wait til you hear what sent me over the top...\\n\\nWhen our server came back (who was very nice and apologetic this entire time) I asked her if she told him that I didn't want the salad at all, no matter how much chicken they put on it, she said (and I fully believe her) \\\"Yes, I told him that\\\". So I told her how he lied to me and threw her under the bus. THAT is just inexcusable. Forget to put an order in, fine. Something not cooked right, oopps.  Throw one of your workers under the bus? Piss poor.\\n\\nOh yeah, and the app we ordered was zucchini hold the cheese, and it came with cheese, and the side of sausage never came out.\\n\\nWould I ever go there again? Not a chance.

It has been nearly three years since we've needed plumbing services so I guess I consider myself pretty lucky. \\n\\nUnfortunately, that lucky streak ended last night when the kitchen pipes sprung a massive leak. I jumped on Yelp and searched for plumbers in my area. When I saw that Sav-On was a Yelp advertiser and highly rated, I jumped onto the phone and made an appointment. (Tom?) seemed really nice on the phone. He said he couldn't get out tonight but that he would come the next day at 3 or 4pm. I told him I had class until 3pm so he said he'd be by between 4 and 4:30pm. I said that would be very convenient for me and made the date. \\n\\nCut to this afternoon. I rushed home after class and waited. And waited. And waited. 4pm rolled by. Then 4:30. My husband called and was told someone would call us right back. 5pm and nothing. I called them and Tom said that because my husband gave the wrong name on the appointment they didn't know who we were. Okay, so I will place HALF the blame on my husband, BUT since he gave them a functional return number, I would assume that the proper etiquette would have been to return the call to say that they didn't have us scheduled for a call. Tom apologized and said it was his fault for not double checking the address with his technician. I said everything was legit and I would just love an ETA, as it was getting late. We hung up. And I waited. And waited. Between 5:30pm and 6:30pm I called Tom an additional FOUR times only to be greeted by Tom's voicemail. At 7pm I decided it was time to call another company. \\n\\nIt is now 7:30pm. Three and a half hours without even a COURTESY CALL or an APOLOGY or an UPDATE is unacceptable. I am now calling Diamondback Plumbing and Parker and Sons, so hopefully between the two of them I can find a real keeper. You would think in a recession, people would be thrilled for work - apparently good customer service continues to elude service people even in the worst of times. It truly is a damned shame because I really did want to like these guys - my only regrets (other than not getting to review them on their service and prices) are that I STILL can't use my stupid kitchen, and I can't assign a lower score than one star.

When the bill came I had no problem paying the $300 or so because it was well worth it. Taste, portions, service. All A+ \\n\\non a side note, we went all out and there are a lot of less expensive items on the menu so price is relative to what you order. The Assume service is shared by everyone."}
{"_id": 1, "text": "ZuZu? Orange Table?  D'lish? The Breakfast Club?  OR Daily Dose?  This is what my husband and I pondered early Sunday morning as we planned to meet another couple for brunch.  After reading numerous Yelp reviews and a few other sites, Daily Dose was the decision!  \\nThe four of us were seated outside at a raised table.  Nice!  Inside seemed really claustrophobic and dark, so to be outside was great.  Our waitress was slow to arrive, but time passed easily as we were caught up in conversation.  I had read that Daily Dose had the BEST Bloody Marys in town.  So we all ordered one.  I love celery in mine, but I guess they do not garnish with celery, but the waitress said she would do it if I wanted.  We all ordered them spicy too.  We couldn't wait!!!!!!!  But we DID wait........and wait.......and wait......and wait, well you get my drift.  They finally came!  With a green onion as a garnish!?!  OK, Celery?  Oh, it WAS in there, just a tiny short piece that was halfway down the glass.  Well, she did have it in there.  \\nThe menu item choices were impressive!  They looked so creative!  I was excited to order! We ordered the breakfast nachos, which everyone on Yelp raved about!  We also ordered the eggs benedict with prime rib and the Southwest Flannel Hash.  And then we waited, and waited and waited......\\nEVERYONE on the patio had no food.  NONE!  I love looking at what other people have ordered, but not one person on the \\\"packed\\\" patio had food.  Not in any stage- just starting, just finishing, in the middle, nothing.  Many did not have anything but water.  I couldn't believe how long the service took.    FINALLY, our food came with no apology of how long it took.  My husband and I shared our order of nachos and prime rib eggs benedict.  The eggs benedict looked good, but when I cut into it, it was a snotty, white mess of undercooked egg white.  In my experience, the only runny part should be the yoke, right?  Well, although I would have preferred the white to have been cooked, my husband and I ate it anyway.  The prime rib was virtually nonexistent.  The breakfast nachos were a HUGE disappointment.  The chorizo was more like flavorless ground meat.  No zing or heat.  The scrambled eggs on it were dry, overcooked, and tasted of sulfur - which is what happens to scrambled eggs when they are over cooked.  There was supposed to be mozzarella cheese on them.  Where?   I don't know, but the nachos were covered in a gluey sauce that I assume was supposed to be a nacho cheese of some sort?  There was also a cup of the gluey sauce on the side.  I guess they felt we needed more? The chips were so greasy, most were translucent.  We didn't eat most of it, just tried to pick and find the edible parts.  By that time we were so hungry and who knows where our 18 year old waitress was to make a complaint anyway.  My friend's Southwest Flannel Hash, which she let me sample, were the WORST I ever had.  I mean how can you mess up corned beef hash?  There was a weird sweet component to it.  She did not finish it, which is odd because she loves corned beef hash and always finishes it.  Her Husband had the prime rib eggs benedict like I did.  He is in the restaurant industry and manages a very popular resort restaurant and he was not happy with his meal at all.  Especially the prime rib part.  I was with him on that one.  To wrap up our  two and  1/2 hour brunch  experience (yes it took that long from start to finish due to slow service) Daily Dose was flat bland, busy and overpriced.   Sorry brother and sister Yelpers, I am in disagreement on this one."}

(I recently paid $65 for Chinese delivery to my office for four lunch specials, crab puffs, $8 delivery charge, and tip.)  I ordered the pineapple fried rice. I love spicy food. I'm the friend who makes fun of everyone else for eating things at 0 spiciness. I ordered this dish at a 6, thinking it would be on the hot side of medium spiciness. This was one of the spiciest dishes I have ever been served. It was inedible, because not only was it extremely spicy but the pineapples had been cooked so much they were completely flavorless, which is something I've never experienced before. So there was no balancing sweet flavor, it was just insane spiciness that overwheled everything. I am with a friend who also loves spicy food, and it was too much for him, too. He ordered another dish at a spiciness level of 3, which seemed to have no bite at all. Mine was definitely not twice as spicy as his, it was at least 10 times as spicy. I've ordered 8s and 9s that weren't this hot. He also was weirded out by the totally flavorless pineapple. \\n\\nMy friend's level 3 completely unspicy dish was fine; it was crab fried rice.  It wasn't anything special; just regular fried rice with a little bit of crab.  We ended up sharing that because neither of us could stomach mine.\\n\\nI am addicted to sticky rice. It's one of my all-time favorite desserts. Bangkok Thai's sticky rice came in a sealed plastic bag, apparently directly out of the microwave, with a coconut milk sauce that didn't have nearly enough sugar. It was overall bland, I tried some of the nuts that were on the side with it; they turned out to be peanuts, which I don't love to begin with, but when a couple of peanuts totally overwhelm the taste of what you're eating, you know that it's not very flavorful. The coconut custard was OK, but not amazing. I've definitely had better. I used to live near Thai Lotus and would frequently get delivery from them; their sticky rice with custard was AMAZING. I'm really sad there's no decent non-pizza places that deliver to my new apartment. \\n\\nFor a $50 delivery order, I was extremely disappointed. Worst $50 I've ever spent on a meal."}

While prices are on the high side given the casual setting, I have found the food to be particularly well composed.\\n\\nI'm a HUUUUUUGE fanboy of their Milano pizza (mild Italian sausage, tomato sauce, green peppers, mushrooms, caramelized onions, fresh herbs, mixture of mozzarella, gorgonzola and parmesan cheese).  The thin crust offers a pleasing combination of exterior crunch and interior chew.  On its own, the sauce is not exceptional, but it effectively compliments the crust and toppings.  The toppings are the real star - I adore the interplay between the sweet caramelized onions, the perfectly seasoned Italian sausage and the three cheese topping of this pie.  This pizza also travels well, making it a great carryout choice.   My only qualm is the price, at $17.99 for a 12\\\" pizza is steep, especially when a person can go to Pizza Brutta, Lombardino's or Grampa's and get a great pizza for $5 less.\\n\\nAt lunch recently, I wandered off the Milano pizza reservation and tried the Italian Beef Panini accompanied by a bag of chips ($8.59).  The sandwich featured a thickly sliced crusty white bread that had a great sear from the grill.  Like the pizza, the well-composed flavor combinations of the sandwich won me over.  While it's a busy sandwich (roast beef, roasted red peppers, onions, mushrooms, basil pesto, smoked red pepper aioli and mozzarella), the components really complement one another.  Again, the price is on the high side at $8.59, but absolutely no complaints about the quality of the sandwich.\\n\\nWhile the restaurant serves up a full dessert menu, including twelve types of gelatos, I usually find myself taking the short walk down the block to Bloom Bake Shop to grab a pastry on the way back to my car.\\n\\nPartitioned into several dining areas, the interior of the restaurant allows you to have an intimate meal with your dining companion, even though the place is always packed with lunch time diners.

{"_id": 1, "text": "On the positive side, the food was good and our waiter was very good. However, the food and wine was way overpriced. I noticed a few bottles that I am familiar with that were twice as much as other restaurants. While the food was good, it was a $35 steak, not a $55 steak. One other thing to mention is the ambiance. I marveled at the decorations and fixtures as they are going after an upscale cafeteria. -Strange. The floor, walls, and ceilings are obviously meant to reflect sound and not absorb  it. It was a loud scene even though it was not full. I would only go back again if I was staying at the Palms, did not want to go far, I did not want to talk to or hear the people I was with, and the meal was comped."}

Well we all know most of the time there is a catch and free might actually mean just tax, just labor whatever but still i had three watches and maybe I would get one for battery free. So i get there and the man who i assume is the owner see's the coupon and immediatley gives me the stink eye. I show him the watches a he says \\\" well these need a tag batteries. (whaaat??????????) i ask \\\"Tag makes special batteries???\\\" . NO he says but you dont put \\\"cheap\\\" batteries in such quality watches.Unless you want to ruin them and thenhe said \\\"I dont care what you do their not my watches\\\"\\n. Ok so wait.. how much are these special better batteries.. He says $25.00 each but since i have a coupon he'll do it for $20 each {gee thanks} i figuire ok im here fine whatever. he looks at my other watch ..the less impressive citizen and tells me it will have to go to the factory for service to replace the battery as it is a Eco-drive. Ok these are my watches and i should know more about them or at least at a minimum what they are or do ..i admit i may not work to care enough about certain things ..as he is putting the battery in the first tag he stops and says that its not working and there is  water in the case...but not to worry he can fix it for $180.00 if its just the gears ..i ask \\\"if its not just the gears\\\"??? he says\\\" DONT WORRY ILL HELP YOU OUT\\\". later on these words will paint a much different definition of the word HELP. I ask him to just put a battery in the other TAG watch and ill talk to my wife about what she wants to do about the first watch( they are both hers). he insists the first watch isnt working , and he doesnt even want to put the back cap back on..beacause it will rust and ruin it ultimately. He kindly offers to do the work and i can pick it up when i have the money, Now i was raised if you can pay for it then do it but im not going to risk losing the watch in case he comes up with some crazy amount that the work cost..Nope not goanna do it. I ask him to put the watch in a bag (he does) and he puts the battery in the other watch and charges me $20. thats the deal with the FREE coupon. So i leave. Now I also found a coupon for GABRIEL JEWELERS, down the street, $3.99 for a watch battery. I take the other two watches ( the now uncapped tag and the citizen) thinking maybe they will have a better price for ALL the WORK these 2 broken watches need. I hand the lady the Tag and the coupon she takes it and says\\\" one minute\\\" takes it to the tech... comes back takes my other watch and asks \\\"are you sure it broken.\\\".i answer \\\"well no i need a battery from the factory right??\\\"..she then informs me to just leave it in the light and that recharges the battery...huh??? wait i thought it needed to go to the factory. she says \\\" if you keep it in the dark9 in a drawer box etc. it runs down, its a good idea to put it in the light for hours beforeyou use or wear it and presto it works.. in fact it started working while i was standing there.  but wait how can that be? it doesnt work.....at least thats what the man at FREIJ or Mr. Freij had said. she leaves then returns and shows me the TAG watch...holy smokes its working. i ask about the special batteries that for sure this watch needs...the look on her face answered that question.and the water?? it not a big deal it will be okay. so about 20 minutes before i walked through the door of GABRIELs i was thinking it would cost $300.00 to maybe $400.00 dollars to ever see these 2 watches working again and that was with the \\\"HELP\\\" of Mr FRIEJ..lucky for me he was so cool to HELP me out Right???.. but some how, some way both watches worked and it cost me a whooping $4.00. For some business' or some people times have been tough with the economy or whatever.. but you know when the business states its been around since 1940 i really thought i wouldnt have to worry about being Helped which in this case wasnt helping me but trying to get me to spend money on work that was'nt nessessary. and ill say it that way beacause for a business that has been around as long as they have,  im sure or at least i hope..it was'nt always possible for this kind of thing to happen. I will not be going back to this store and felt that i should share what happend. Now i must say he did put the battery in the second watch and it works. I just got lured in to this store with a coupon for a \\\"free\\\" service that ended up costing more than what is usally charged, in fact double. I could have said forget it and not bought anything but i did thats on me. but its a watch battery. i didnt think i would need a second opinion. Thats what happend to me with regard to needing to buy batteries for some watches and thats all i can speak to."}

The waitresses' bad attitude and poor service.  3 of us did the AYCE for $26, and 1 person ordered a korean dish.  \\n\\nFirst off, when we got seated, the waitress took 3 out of the 4 drink orders, and then walked away. We had to shout the 4th drink order.  After we ordered our AYCE sushi items (limited to one order of sea urchin (uni) and 1 order of sweet shrimp, we waited... and waited... for our food. The appetizers like the tempura and gyoza were fine, although I had to ask for tempura sauce.  What place does not bring tempura sauce with tempura? This should have been a red flag, as I had to ask for it. The rest of the sushi came out very very slow, especially for being nearly empty on a friday night at 7pm.  \\nFinally the first sushi order (tuna) came out.  It's one thing if the sushi looks like it got rolled over by a car and died 2 weeks ago, but it actually tasted like it died 2 weeks ago and got rolled over by a car, and then sliced and put on top a very hefty wad of mushy rice.  It was tasteless.  The lack of flavor was attempted to be hidden by the sushi chef adding a clump of wasabi underneath.  \\nThe rice quality was nothing that great either. It was a step above the quality of rice found at the supermarket.  \\nEverything else that came out had no flavor and there was a lack of excitement about the food.  \\nWe had to wait 90 minutes before we finally got fed up, and said, where is our uni?!  The manager in charge said he would go check.  He came back a couple minutes later saying it would be out in a couple minutes as they just opened up a new box.  (Really?  they couldn't have opened up the new box when we ordered the food?)  The uni was fine, nothing horrible, but nothing that great either.  \\nThe last sushi order they brought out was the white tuna which I usually like, but it was just horrible.  It was warm, melted in your mouth (not because it was good quality, but because it was just so waterlogged), and it had a weird almost alcoholic flavor to it. I spit it out and sent it back via the waitress who plainly ignored me until another waitress came by.  They were also very slow at servicing our table as we would stack our own plates to make room.  We also had to constantly ask for tea, but at least they kept my friend's soda cup full.  \\nMy korean friend told me that her korean dish was awful as well. She only ate half of it.  \\nOverall, this restaurant is horrible.  The korean food is not good, and neither is the sushi.  1 star was given because that's the bare minimum that must be given and inside the restaurant looked very nice and modern.   This place does not deserve to serve sushi."}

{"_id": 0, "text": "food: two stars (* *)\\nRarely am I disappointed eating at an Italian restaurant of any caliber.  Sadly, this \\\"Enoteca\\\" failed to deliver.  I split the special salad with my fellow diner, which was grilled radicchio with mozzarella melted on top.  The waiter gushed about it as if this salad, conceptually, had changed the culinary arts forever.  What we received was chopped grilled radicchio smothered in about twice as much cheese as was necessary and drizzled with some balsamic.  It was tasty but sloppily executed.  The pasta dish we ordered, Bucatini all'Amatriciana, was about 1/4lb of pasta with a light tomato sauce and (no joke) 3 tiny pieces of cured pork and 4 tiny pieces of chopped onion on it.  It was as tasty as any pasta you would order at Olive Garden, and vastly overpriced.\\n\\nenvironment/service: one star (*)\\nThis service was some of the worst I have ever received at a restaurant of this caliber.  We waited for our table, were seated and left out to dry for 10 minutes.  Finally, a waiter dropped off some bread and bread sticks encased in paper, with nothing to put on it (butter, olive oil).  Eventually our main waiter came to the table, where I had to ask to have him bring olive oil, vinegar and salt and pepper to the table.  We ordered, and that was the last we saw him until I had to flag him down to get our check.  Nobody, from him, to the wine opener, to the other servers who delivered our plates, was friendly or passionate about their jobs.  Dirty plates sat on the table after eating for about 15 minutes.  The fact that they added a 20% \\\"service\\\" charge onto the bill was offensive.  The environment, a cliche Venetian \\\"plaza,\\\" was pure Vegas--all style and no substance.\\n\\nvalue: one star (*)\\nAny pasta dish priced above $18 (especially for 1/4lb of pasta) better be pretty damn good.  This wasn't.  It was obscenely overpriced, like much of the food in Vegas.  The salad was about $15, which was high for one chopped vegetable with cheese melted on top.

{"_id": 0, "text": "I bought my Honda new in 2007 from Honda West and have taken it there for all the maintenance (oil changes) etc. Every time I had an oil change, they always say ALL the fluids get topped off. I had always trusted that they did.  Well, be ware. The last time my oil was changed, my windshield wiper fluid was bone dry. I had noticed the place was unusually dead. I had mentioned to the guy that the windshield fluid was completely empty and he told me that is the first thing they do is top off the fluids. I also noticed that their prices had really gone up since my last oil change. Anyway they were finished with the oil change in record time. When I was on my way home I tried the windshield wipers, and it was still bone dry. So my concern was if they didn't even fill my wiper fluid, then they obviously didn't check the radiator fluid, break fluid, power steering fluid, transmission fluid. Last time I checked, they are considered fluids, are they not? So I went to auto parts store and got some wiper fluid which they should have taken care of for the price they charge. My radiator fluid is low, and so is the break fluid. Well I called them back and spoke to the service manager and asked him what kind of an operation they run over there? He claims he had no idea the guy didn't check my fluids and told me to bring the car back, but I already lost confidence in them at this point. So the bottom line is they have a sign out front that lists all the things they do with the oil change, which I might add is NOT cheap, and all they did was change the oil. But did they really do that even? \\nI will not be returning to Honda West based on my own experience and what I've heard from other people. Bu bye."}

{"_id": 1, "text": "Honestly, I'm very surprised at how disappointing my experience was. We showed up around 6 on a weeknight and the place was pretty empty. Strangely, we weren't greeted by anyone when we came in, and we weren't sure if that meant we were supposed to wait or seat ourselves, so we waited and felt awkward about it. After about a minute and a half, one of the servers came out and noticed us standing there so he refilled someone's water and then showed us to our table.\\n\\nThe service was fine, no real complaints there. We ordered the Grapes, Arugula, and Ricotta Flatbread for the appetizer. For the entrees we ordered the Shrimp Po' Boy and the Chicken Parmigiana. The flatbread had great flavors, but it was seriously unwieldy. I admit that I can, at times, be coordinationally-challenged... but in my defense this was a piece of flatbread that had grapes and candied walnuts sitting on it, with no sharp knife to cut it into pieces. We ended up with a lot of sticky balsamic glaze on our hands, and I personally got a couple of grapes and walnuts in my lap and on the floor. So that was fun. \\n\\nHer Shrimp Po' Boy sandwich was good. Though in my opinion the small garnish salad on the side was a little measly looking. My Chicken Parmigiana was kind of crazy. The chicken itself was this massive flattened piece of chicken that covered almost the entire plate. I have never seen a piece of chicken like this, I wish I had taken a picture. Anyway, it was breaded and fried, and then set on top of a pile of watery, bland spaghetti. And I mean watery as in, when I tipped the bowl, about a quarter cup of water came forth. That was the water that hadn't already absorbed into the bottom of the chicken breading. It was soggy and strange and disappointing. The flavor of the chicken and breading was good, but I couldn't get over the sog factor. The pasta was unappetizing and I couldn't really eat much of it. \\n\\nThe cocktails were nothing to write home about, especially for the price. I got something with \\\"fresh\\\" blueberries in it... and dared to eat one of them. It had no flavor, other than the taste of (possibly) freezer burn.. and the mealy texture that fruit sometimes gets. It was very gross.\\n\\nThe last thing I feel like mentioning just for the sake of being a complainer is that they were playing a collection of popular songs covered by someone on piano/violin. This included Sweet Child O' Mine by Guns N' Roses, and Unforgiven (I think?) by Metallica. Though there were no vocals in the recording, that didn't stop the guy at the table next to us from rocking out with his best Axl Rose impression. It made for an interesting ambiance, but it wasn't quite my cup o' tea.\\n\\nBottom line, I won't be back, and I won't be recommending it to anyone. I'm not much of a Yelp reviewer but this place has such amazing ratings I was left feeling confused by my experience and thought I should chime in."}

It came with a choice of 2 or 3 filets with a handsome portion of seasoned fries, cole slaw and a homemade tartar and vinegar on the side.  Very nice flavor on the crip of the fish, but just a touch too breaded for me. Points for crispness and flakiness of the fish, though. Very well done. Fries and tartar were good as well; very hot and fresh, respectively.  My friend ordered a chicken salad, and we had the hummus plate for an app. Yes, hummus.  This place has a pretty varied menu, which always gives me pause. From Margarita pizzas to Tandoori Chicken to Enchiladas, it's all over the map.   Our server, Chad, was great and attentive.

We almost didn't walk down the 'grand staircase'. But we did. So much for second guessing the quality of the food by the name of the restaurant. The food was great! We had: uber fresh, briny, sweet oysters on the half shell--YUM!, a generous serving of thin sliced Iberico ham (but not paper thin) served with arugula, small wedges of manchego cheese, green olives in olive oil and grilled ciabatta points, super soft grilled octopus served nestled on a tasty white bean salad with sherry vinegar and roasted garlic aioli, braised wagyu short ribs with gnocchi, parmesan cheese, roasted tomatoes, english peas, and flavorful wood fire grilled lemon garlic king prawns. The food was fresh and the flavors bold and forthright. No complaints about the food at all. The food was deeeelish! The 'show' in the 'magic pond' (aka the pond of dreams) was entertaining and great photo op amusing. Our waitperson, Douglas, was personable, polite and very accomodating when we asked to be moved indoors (the outdoor tables were too cold for us). So, the flaws with this reastaurant?...The outdoor patio is the place to be, however, the outdoor 'heaters' don't throw off enough heat to keep the outdoor patio diners warm and cozy. We had to ask to be moved indoors. Unfortunately the indoor tables lack the 'ambiance' of the outdoor tables. The lighting in the indoor dining area is bright and when combined with the modern dining room tables and the overall modern decor, feels jarringly harsh. The combination of the bright light and modern furniture gives the dining area a 'cafeteria' feel. So, to summarize, great food, junk name for the restaurant -- come on--you guys at Wynn can come up with a name more creative than \\\"Lakeside\\\"? and junk ambiance in the indoor dining area (too bright and not cozy)."}

I got an external and intra-vaginal ultrasound, just to hear the CT Scan guy talking to another ultrasound guy about how I wasn't actually in pain at all. They insisted on giving me a CT Scan, telling me radiation wasn't involved. Liar. I refused. \\n\\nAfter another 1 1/2 hours of sitting in the waiting room, they finally bring me down what felt like every hallway in the entire hospital; which, by the way are all in midi-construction AND lined with patients laying in beds moaning and groaning - with handwritten signs above their head stating which 'room' they are in. \\n\\nThe lady at the desk, turns out to be a nurse - she tells me to put on a hospital robe because I'm having a pelvic exam. an hour later when a male nurse comes in, he looks at me like I'm crazy because I'm half-naked. He hooks me up to a blood pressure machine and heart rate monitor and shuts the lights off on his way out because he says \\\"You'll be here a while\\\"...it's already been 6 hours. \\n\\nThe doctor finally comes in and talks to me about my gall stone history...you know, the one I don't have. Then he says, \\\"Well, looks like there's nothing wrong with you - you can go!\\\"\\n\\nNever again."}

One of them was about to cancel his order he was so steamed.\\n\\n Stuffed shells were good but I felt jipped by the portions compared to the Chicken Parm plate somebody else got at basically the same price. The shells definitely needed a meat sauce rather than their thin marinara. The Chicken Parm was humongous in size. It looked like an entire chicken! Tasty, too. Calzones are pretty good, too.

Once in a while the chicken gets a little overcooked and dry. Just a warning, if you get the food to-go, they include the salad with your warm food in the same tray. Not a fan of hot salad, nor am I a fan of salad dressing sloshing all over Thai food - it's like a bad Circus Circus buffet nightmare. So simply ask for the salad on the side.

{"_id": 4, "text": "There's nothing like a great steak, and there's plenty of them in Las Vegas, that's for sure.  But there are certain places that are able to differentiate themselves from the herd of great steakhouses.  Hank's is one of those places.  Hank's combines a modern, yet comfortable atmosphere with top-notch steaks, seafood, and drinks.  \\n\\nArriving at your table in Hank's, the first thing you notice is the large \\\"fish-tank fireplace\\\".  Separating two of the rooms at Hank's is a large tank with glass panels on both sides containing a large fireplace.  This is a great touch on the ambience, and is a very good backdrop instead of just a wall or a picture.  \\n\\nI can't comment on the other steaks, but my mom and I both got the 24 oz. Bone-in Ribeye.  This was Nebraska Corn-Fed, Prime, 28-day Aged Ribeye.  Does it get any better?  Oh wait, it does.  We had a 2002 BV Georges de Latour and 2006 Del Dotto Vineyard 887, Missouri U-Stave Cabernet Sauvignon to go with the steak.  While some people say that all of the expensive steakhouses are the same, because all of them are getting the best quality beef.  And I would agree, with the exception of places like Hank's.  \\nThe thing that differentiates Hank's from most other steakhouses is the char they are able to get on the steak.  Ya, I always hear about how every steakhouse has the 1200 degree oven, but not all of them are able to get the char that Hank's does on their steaks.  The steaks came out perfect medium rare, and were also perfectly seasoned.  If there's one thing that any chef appreciates, it's when all the food is well seasoned.  You would be surprised how often even fine dining restaurants under season their food.\\nNot only did they do their steaks great, but everything on our table was perfect.  My Dad got the 12 oz. Tristan Island (South Africa) Lobster Tail.  The Lobster was very large, slightly sweet, perfectly/ simply seasoned, and very tender.  They also had a very large 20 oz. Lobster Tail, which would probably feed literally 4 people as an entree. \\n\\nOur desserts were pretty standard, but very good.  We got the Chocolate Molten Cake and the Sorbets.  Very tasty, but very typical.  If there is one thing they can work on it's the desserts, but it was good enough to keep them at five stars.  \\n\\nThe corkage fee at Hank's was steep, but very typical for Las Vegas.  For wine lovers, Las Vegas is a sort of hell due to the extremely high corkage fees, and the large amount of restaurants that don't let you bring in any wine.  Hank's is a $35 corkage fee, with a two 750 ml bottle limit.  This is pretty much standard for Las Vegas.  \\nThe Sommelier was a very nice guy.  The opening and pouring process was very quick, detailed, and professional.  He noticed the Del Dotto bottle, and we had a short conversation about our mutual love for visiting Del Dotto's winery, and the personality of Dave Del Dotto.  Many Sommelier experiences are snooty and awkward, but their Sommelier was able to talk about bottles that we brought in, and did so in a very educated, yet professional manner. \\n\\nOverall, all of the people at my table while dining here said it was on par with the best steakhouses they have been to, being compared to Gene & Georgetti's and The Chop House in Chicago.  If you are in Las Vegas, and you are able to make it off the strip, check out Hank's, it's a special steak and a special meal."}

Upon the assembly of my costume, several of the glow sticks didn't work.  I tried glow stick after glow stick, and finally was able to get a few of them to work.  This greatly compromised the whole costume, but being unwilling to let this defeat me and ruin the night I had planned with friends, I pressed on.  The costume was just \\\"okay\\\" and if the glow sticks had actually worked, it would have been phenomenal! \\n\\nI had made the decision to not open any more packages with the idea that since their product was defective (more than likely because of kids like the previous review mentioned) that they would certainly refund my money.  They have a no refund policy, which I could understand if I just didn't like it or didn't want it.  But this situation merits special circumstances.  I called the store and explained what happened and was pleasantly surprised that they agreed to a refund.  When I went in to do the refund, I was told no one authorized that.  I was also told by the cashier that in her lucrative 6 year career at the extremely high class establishment, that she has never seen defective glow sticks.  Well that must make her the authority on everything glow stick!  But I digress, I asked to speak to the manager.  He told me that he could exchange the faulty glow sticks for new ones.  I again explained it was part of halloween costume and the time for exchange had long passed.  \\nI will admit that the GPS on my phone caused me to dial a different Dollar Tree store, and they were the ones to offer refund...but I'm curious if refunds are absolutely not possible, why then was the other store willing to do one?  When I discovered that I had dialed a different store and explained that to the Avondale location, I asked why they could give a refund, but he couldn't?  He said they should have never offered it to me.\\n\\nHere is the problem as I see it, if ones merchandise is defective, I don't care what your policy is, give the refund!!!  Also, if another store offered the refund, they should honor it.   I have been in customer service management for over 15 years.  I currently manage a site that does not offer refunds.  But I also know there are always extenuating circumstances, and in those situations, I call those over me and get it done!!!!  Because I would rather at least try to assist the customer than not.  An unsatisfied customer will always remember less than par service, and the same can be said of excellent customer service.  With this being such a high tech day and age, sharing your good or bad experiences is simply at your fingertips for potentially thousands to see.  Was that $15 refund worth the bad review?  Especially in a time when people are suffering the hardest financially?  There are several dollar stores in the Avondale area.  My recommendation is that whomever reads this uses any of those over Dollar Tree.  If you Dollar Tree employees read this, let this be a word to the wise, the consumer right now has the upper hand.  We the consumer have a voice and as choice.  Trust me, this doesn't end here."}

It was good, but a very small portion for $13.  I left hungry.  The risotto looked delicious.  A friend got the yogurt with an extra egg and she seemed to enjoy it.

For example, we had a water jug, but no water glasses.  Then we had glasses but no more water. Had to ask a few times for it before we took a jug from an empty table.  The sangria took a good 20 min to get.  The food also took a while, but it was their first time, so that's understandable I guess.\\n\\nI hope that they improve.  I'd give the brunch 3 stars and the regular hours 4-5 stars.  I'd also love to see the patio that they are planning.

We were greeted right away (the place was pretty empty at 6pm on a Saturday) and seated at the back corner table. We had plenty of time to look at the menu, as our waitress seated a table two up from us, took their drink order, stopped by the table next to ours to check on them, looked at us, walked back to the front of the restaurant, then came back to see if we'd been helped. Uh, no. The person that seated us apparently hadn't told her we were seated - even though it was her section and she saw us when checking on the other customers. She did apologize, but I didn't buy it. There's a difference between trying to pass the buck and blame someone else vs. actually being sorry about letting you sit there.\\n\\nOk, over that. Let's order. Couple beers, and a couple of signature sandwiches (pulled pork, with the blue cheese cole slaw not on the sandwich for one). For our sides, HQ (that's the wife) got the mac-n-cheese and I asked her choice between fries and mashed potatoes. Fries were good, she said. Done.\\n\\nGot the beers. I'd swear the beer was flat. Maybe an old keg. It happens. After that, the food came out quick. The pulled-pork sandwich had zero sauce. Literally just bun and pulled pork. Ok, we'll add our own from the bottle on the table (I'm thinking Honey Bears where it's got bbq sauce with the meat). The sandwich was average at best. No taste. The sauce, not being mixed with the meat, just had nothing to it. And the blue cheese cole slaw that was on the side, again, absolutely no taste. Bland. Now the fries. The menu said Russett Fries. I guess I'm picturing steak-like fries. Nope. Just plain ol' fies. And these were not actually cooked all the way. Not good.\\n\\nTo summarize: flat beer, bland bbq sandwich, bland blue cheese cole slaw, and undercooked fries. Safe to say it's not a place we'll go to again."}

We were not our favorites the oven is very hot that makes the bottom of the pizza get chard but the dough itself is a little chewy and it got soggy very quickly the sausage could have been cooked a little bit longer.

I got crap on twitter because my friends knew I was going to Delux, but getting the soup instead of a burger.  C'est la vie...last week, my cravings were to strong and I had to give in.  Burgers will have to wait.\\n\\nI went to Delux 2 Go specifically for the soup.  I decided to surprise my boyfriend with lunch and ordered him one too.  Delux sells soups daily.  They make lobster bisque on Wednesdays. A schedule of their soups is on their menu which can be found on their website.\\n\\nI also ordered the tomato mozzarella salad.  I can never pass up a caprese salad.  While I waited for my order they offered me a water or iced tea.  I thought that was really nice.  The soups hit the spot.  The salad not so much.  The tomatoes and cheese were fresh.  I had problems with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Both came in their own containers.  I tried mixing them without success.  I tried dipping it.

The beds are insanely comfortable as well.\\n\\nThe negatives are that there is almost no staff, and if you have a room on the top floor, you have to lug your own luggage up several flights of stairs because there is no elevator. They also have no restaurant or room service. They used to have a deal with the restaurant next door so you could at least have your breakfast there. Now, they give you coupons for a restaurant a block away (which is kind of like a Starbucks--not a restaurant at all).\\n\\nConsidering it's quite a bit pricier than, say, the Best Western, you'd think you'd be accommodated more in terms of staff and restaurant service. \\n\\nFor all its quaintness, I'm afraid I'm too old to drag my luggage up flights of stairs. I'm also too old to be giving a coupon to a guy in a coffee shop for my breakfast--that part is just embarrassing (and, frankly, we just ended up tossing the coupons after the first day and having a nice hot breakfast in the restaurant next door).\\n\\nOh, and the worst part: the internet is very spotty if you stay above the second floor!

The ONLY thing we really couldn't stand was how far the parking lot is to the tower. Between going through the entire casino, bars, and the whole pyramid to the other side it was horrible after a 9 hour drive with a bunch of luggage! The room it self was really nice, the desk chair was a bit dirty . But all in all we would stay there again. The Luxor buffet was the best one we've been to compared to a few others on the strip.

Looked like gristle running through center of the steak, and small and overly fatty - not neatly trimmed at all. Didn't get that,  got ground beef instead.

{"_id": 4, "text": "It feels senseless attempting to use written words to portray the three-day nirvana that was EDC 2012...but here goes nothing!\\n\\nEDC 2012 was my third EDC.This year, I arrived in Las Vegas with two goals: the first, to not end up separated from my crew (which I somehow managed to do not once, not twice, but on all three days of EDC 2011)...and the second, to dive in to EDC headfirst and finish the weekend with no regrets... \\n\\nBoth of these goals were accomplished by leaps and bounds, despite the fact that EDC required my friends and I to bust more missions than I ever considered myself capable of (thanks in no small part to a wallet/EDC ticket/ID/credit card that was stolen on the dancefloor, our befriending of a lovely Canadian girl who had arrived in Las Vegas with nowhere to stay for the weekend, one friend's parents threatening the disownment of their daughter, and a host of other situations that brought my friends and I closer together than ever before). For the weekend to have turned out to be such a RESOUNDING success despite the onset of one shitshow setback after another shows how truly special and amazing of an event EDC is. Anyways, here are my highlights:\\n\\n- Dusk 'til dawn! EDC's most unique characteristic is the festival's \\\"sunset to sunrise\\\" format, which demands as much as your body and your willpower are willing to put out - you'll find yourself with a reversed body clock by the end of the third day. Go for the three-day stretch - you'll find yourself with a newfound appreciation for yourself and the limits of your body.\\n\\n- The talent! Insomniac spared no expense in assembling a world-class lineup of DJs for EDC 2012. In a span of three days, I was able to see Steve Angello, Kaskade, Calvin Harris, Dada Life, Knife Party, and a whole host of the best that electronic/dance music has to offer. Every DJ who played at EDC brought their A-game, throwing down banger after banger and keepin' the party rockin'. I will never forget screaming \\\"This IS Paradise\\\" at the top of my lungs while seeing Fedde Le Grand bring in sunrise with his tune of the same name...nor will I forget hitching a ride atop a VIP cart in the heart of the crowd during David Guetta's \\\"Without You\\\", waving out to a sea of people, all of whom were cheering right back at my friends and I.\\n\\n- The production value, stage designs and lighting effects that were nothing short of world class...\\n\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6NG_A-epYEpsJSugfAaTRQ?select=oKal-wTRBxCJjWzIhcaXig#6sN5BGLpzMnJjYIcjSyt_w\\n\\nEDC fully displays Insomniac's credo - \\\"it's all about the experience.\\\" The Kinetic Field - although not as jaw-dropping as last year's office building-sized structure, was \\\"hollow\\\", in that festival goers were now able to view sunrise through the stage itself. Equally breathtaking were the visual displays accompanying each DJ set; oozing neon colors and trippy illustrations came straight out of (the best kind of) an acid trip. I witnessed dozens of acrobats, costumed performers, fire dancers , and the ever-popular Mirror Man grace EDC with their talents; no details were overlooked in terms of the event's aesthetics. For example, the Red Bull Skydivers glided down to earth, shooting sparks each night...legit.\\n\\nOH, and I haven't even gotten to the fireworks yet. It looks like EDC has prematurely spoiled my 4th of July...\\n\\n- The sense of togetherness found within the crowds at EDC is unlike that of any other event. Because EDC calls for a serious investment of time, money, and energy, there's a filter effect that takes place. Obnoxious assholes and creepy hoodie-wearing tweakers are very much the minority at EDCLV (unlike most massive events held within the SoCal area), and I can speak from experience in saying that the overwhelming majority of the people that I met at EDC were fun-loving partygoers who were very polite (making way for your chain of head-bobbing friends as you navigate a crowd), down-to-earth, and friendly. \\n\\nThis same sense of good-natured behavior was emphasized by the Speedway staff and the Las Vegas Metro PD; when my friend lost his wallet, the police officers whom we asked for help were very much courteous (albeit powerless, as no definite lost & found had been set up...lovely). Did I mention that we hitchhiked our way back to the strip with some awesome Good Samiritan ravers on the first night (due to aforementioned stolen wallet)? EDC gives me faith in the good nature of human beings.\\n\\nI could go on and on, but really you'd have to experience EDC for yourself to fully know just how inspiring and life-changing of an event this is. I didn't really touch on the cons of EDC 2012 (god-awful traffic to/from the Speedway, inept organization with regards to the lost & found, a lack of food options to choose from, Mother Nature giving Saturday night the middle finger), but frankly, that's because all negativity had been erased from my mind for the weekend. For three days, EDC enabled my friends and I to touch the sky!"}

My friend was like, \\\"Hey, why not....\\\" and into the parking lot she turned. \\n\\nLike other people have said it's not the most spectacular looking place from the street...plopped at the end of a shopping center. I wasn't expecting much....but it kind of turned out like a Susan Boyle.....that whole judging a book by it's cover thing. \\n\\nService was prompt and attentive. It's a small place and it didn't seem too busy. We sat on the patio and I have to say that parking lot is the QUIETEST parking lot of any shopping center I've ever been in. Very relaxing. \\n\\nLike I said, I wasn't expecting much and wasn't sure what to order. I was torn between a few things and ended up ordering the fettuccine alfredo. As soon as I ordered it I was like, \\\"Ugh...why did I order that?\\\" It's just sometimes a restaurant will make a fettuccine alfredo that just leaves a strange aftertaste in my mouth. Don't know if it's the cheese they use or what. So, like I said, I was dreading it. That whole Susan Boyle thing I alluded to earlier. \\n\\nStarted with some bread and a small salad with a creamy Italian dressing. Pretty good. \\n\\nThen out came my fettuccine alfredo. It looked good....and it smelled good. And I have to admit it was the BEST fettuccine alfredo I've ever had. Creamy, rich, and oh so good. I was SO happy I ordered it. \\n\\nWe ended with a creme carmel for dessert which was just right to top off our dinner. \\n\\nAfter dinner went inside to use the restroom and the restaurant was even smaller inside than I thought. \\n\\nChatted a bit with one of the employees about the restaurant and the owners. Very friendly and warm atmosphere. \\n\\nI don't get out that way much but if I'm around there again I will definitely stop in again.

If you're lucky, you can get in and out of the yogurt shop within 5-10min however, if there is just ONE more person than you, you might end up waiting for 20+min. When I went, there was only one lady in front of me and she ordered two smoothies. The worker took her order and immediately went to make her drinks without  even acknowleding me.. not even a \\\"I'll be right with you\\\". In addition, I also thought that you should take orders in batches and since I was right after her, I just assumed he could take my order also before going on to make it (just in case we had the same order so he could save time and make it double). \\nHowever, what really irritated me is that this guy took 15+min to make TWO smoothies. I know he really wanted to make the drinks as smooth as possible but c'mon! I'm not exactly sure how long it took him because I left after 15min.

So we walked in with a party of 15 and it took 10-15 minutes for us to get seated.  I understood that as this is not a normal sized party.  I ordered the spring rolls with shrimp and pho xe lua.  First off, I noticed how much more they charged here compared to LA.  \\nThe spring rolls were just ok.  Didn't have much flavor to it.  The dipping sauce did help, but still not that good.  My pho came out and I wasn't sure it was mine because it was a regular sized bowl.  From my experience, xe lua is supposed to be an extra large.  I thought that's why I paid extra for it.  I even asked the server and he said that the xe lua was the same as the dac biet.  \\nI was confused, but I still ate it and didn't make a big deal about it.  When I took my first bite, I was underwhelmed by the taste.  The soup didn't have that much flavor even after putting in the hoisin, veggies and lime.  The noodles wasn't fresh tasting like I'm used to.  I forgot to mention that the food was luke warm.  It's not piping hot like it's supposed to be.  The meat was just ok.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  \\nAll in all, I would not come back to this establishment if I am ever in Vegas and craving for Pho.  There are so many other choices to choose from, and this one really bites.  The thing that really confuses me is that this is part of a chain and there is one located in Van Nuys that taste better than this place.  Food quality is definitely lacking at this Vegas location and they need to re-evaluate their whole business strategy."}

Supposedly nothing was wrong with any of the parts and everything was fine.  I was obviously hallucinating the grinding and squeaking.  Seems this is par for the course at Just Brakes for their work and parts to fail after 10k miles.

Mike made the situation right with me and offered to Fedex, at no charge to me, my purchase directly to my home.  He was incredibly kind and concerned about my irriatation. That kind of customer service is to be commended and praised!!!  Yes, the corporate part of the company should modify it's online & gift card policies.  It is in my experience that when interacting with clients and customers, you need to make a transaction as easy, as quick and as pleasant as possible!!  \\nThe situation I had was out of the store's control, but yet Mike still went beyond the norm to correct my less than happy experience.\\n\\n2.

It was tender and it was good, but not melt in your mouth fantastic. It was overshadowed by (dun dun dun) the fish!!! \\nSeafood- Chilean sea bass. I got it the \\\"arreganato\\\" way. I probably butchered the word too. Holy crap this was amazing. It melted in your mouth and left you wondering where the heck it went so you just kept going back for more. \\nSides: thanks to the yelper who gave the advice to get half the amt of gnocchi.

First of all i reserved a room with double beds which was unavailable (isn't that what reserve means?) so being that they didn't have my requested room available they put me in a room with one bed and had the nerve to say it was 10 extra dollars!!! Wth?? because supposedly it was strip view which that was an understatement then they asked for a $50 deposit the keys kept not working making it where i had to keep going down to the front desk then when we checked out on the 11th they deducted $8.67 from my $50 deposit stating that it was for their amenities (pool, phones, etc.) which i never took advantage of so now that i know that they are full of it NEVER AGAIN!"}

When we did arrive and finally seated, we weren't offered any of the sparkling wine the rest of the table was drinking.

This shouldn't have been a big deal; I ordered the rockfish, for my date and I to split, and then some lobster bisque, since I'd heard rave reviews (on here) that this was the way to go as far as soups.\\nWe had a party of 12, and while this can sometimes be a daunting task, there wasn't much maintenance to our table.  We had the same bottle of Cava for the entire table and then each person was drinking water. \\nThe bisque came at the same time as  the other appetizers, but he tried to take it away before I was done (pet peeve!). There was a lot left, so there shouldn't have been a question as to whether or not I had finished. \\nDinner came and went. I requested a wine list, but the server asked me after I had finished the entree if I wanted any wine. Desserts, which are made by Tracy Dempsey, were never offered.\\nThe guest check was a disaster! I think they needed an abacus to figure out how to split it. We only wanted it split three ways. Not difficult. It took 25 minutes and three tries.\\nFOOD\\nThis could end up being a four page write up. So I'll try to keep it short.\\nThe fact that I'm in the industry shouldn't deter me from trying new restaurants. But, I was surprisingly underwhelmed with the creativity. And I would regret it If I failed to mention the lack of seasoning, I also despise SPLIT PLATE fees unless you split the plate for me, but when I'm doing all the work - don't you dare charge me 5 dollars.\\n The rockfish portion could have been - and I'm being generous here - 4 ounces. I'd be surprised if it was a four ounce portion. It was four small bites. So, $25 and four bites later....\\nAnd the lobster bisque...no. Under seasoned, thin, and over creamed. At least finish it off with some sherry and I also wouldn't mind a reminder that I'm eating lobster.\\nAMBIENCE\\nwhatever. It was dark.

{"_id": 3, "text": "First off, listen, if you are going to give the hotel 2 stars and say you'll stay at Bellagio next time, that is not helpful! That is comparing apples to oranges. Of COURSE Bellago is nicer, it costs 2-4 times as much.  That's like saying Denny's sucks because Lawry's has way better food.  You need to re-align your expectations if you are expecting the Bellagio when you stay at Monte Carlo. If you are looking for the 20-something wild club scene, this is also not the hotel for you. Do some research.  \\n\\nNow, that said, for the price it is great. I have been staying here exclusively for 3 years ever since my last nightmare stay at a TR property, and I have been very happy. Yes, things go wrong, but this is a huge hotel with thousands of guests moving through everyday. Cut them some slack. You are human too. \\n\\nI don't know why everyone is complaining about wi-fi not working in the rooms. They don't even OFFER free wi-fi in the rooms. Only the first floor, though I have stayed as high as 8th and got it to work. They offer free wired internet in the rooms, but no wi-fi.  \\n\\nI have never found rooms to be dirty. Worn, yes, in need of updating, maybe. But filthy? No. The water pressure is a problem at every huge high rise hotel in Vegas, and everywhere else I have ever stayed in one. \\n\\nThe pool is our absolute favorite of any Las Vegas hotel. Other than the one day it has a pounding DJ and wet bikini contests, it is a mellow, quiet, safe-feeling atmosphere. I love the lazy river and the wave pool, and I have never had a problem getting a chair in the sun or shade.  Wait service is good if you treat them well, and the only one time I saw any misbehavior security was on TOP of it big time (it was just someone who had way too much to drink and was endangering herself by being in the pool, nothing big).  I think this hotel does tend to attract families because of the pool as there are always kids in it, but I have never felt like it was overrun with kids, nor an inappropriate environment for when I do have my kids with me (which is rare). \\n\\nAdmittedly, we don't eat on-property much, we tend to go to other resorts for dining but not because there is anything wrong with MC's food, we just try to brand out and try new things and MC has not had the widest array of choices. Now there are more with the new openings so we may have to try Yusho on our trip this month. \\n\\nValet has always been fast and we use it every time we stay. I like to park once and cab/walk for the whole trip so we don't have to worry about drinking. I also have used the new express/early VIP check-in and it was great. One room of our two was ready by 10am, the other wasn't but they quickly found one that was and we were on our way to the pool less than 20 minutes later. Yes, the line for check-in is long at 3pm on a Friday - it moves very fast and you should see the line at Bellagio if you want to compare! Yikes!! \\n\\nOn our last two trips this year, the casino air was the cleanest it has even been. I did not need my asthma meds once, and not one time did I end up at table with anyone smoking. The air actually seemed pretty darned clean for a casino. \\n\\nOne thing I really do like about Monte Carlo is that it is not enormous and the elevators to the rooms are placed very close to check-in and valet/parking as well as the pool and the tram to Bellagio. I hate nothing more than having to walk half a mile just to get to my room, through a crowded casino, carrying luggage. \\n\\nMonte Carlo is also a good less expensive place to stay if you don't plan on spending any time in your room but just want an inexpensive, quiet, convenient place to crash, hit the spa and relax at the pool, while you do your partying elsewhere.\\n\\nAs for the comment about only \\\"overweight middle-aged White people, and frugal Asians\\\" staying here, that is disgusting and wrong. You've clearly never been to the pool mid-day. Yes, it is a quieter hotel, not a party scene, but that comment is really ugly. Sheesh!"}

Received recommendations for handymen from my realtor and a couple other people, but none of them were available the week of Christmas when I was there.\\n\\nIn desperation I hit the internet and found ELI THE HANDYMAN via his website.  Best find I could have hoped for!  E-mailed Eli, then we spoke on the phone the same day.  He was prompt to e-mail a written bid, and was set up to take payment via credit card.  Nice when you're from out of town as I am!\\n\\nEli proved to more than I could have hoped for.  He lined up a house cleaner, painter & tile crew, plus he and Dana (his employee) met me there Saturday morning at 8:00 AM to get the ball rolling.   He took Sunday off (don't blame him!), then he and his painter worked all day Monday (Christmas Eve...amazing!).  The rest of the week he worked tirelessly replacing ceiling fans, repairing water damage, installing new doors  and more things than I can remember.  Eli even got me a discount on the paint.\\n\\nI give Eli my highest recommendation.

This is the problem I have with a lot of SF restaurants (read: Zuni Cafe, Sebo...). Just because you have good food doesn't mean you can slack on the service. Well Joel Robuchon does not disappoint. We had numerous people come by and explain different meals, options, etc. over the course of the night and our main waiter was phenomenal. Sweet, well spoken, knew all the dishes and gave great recommendations.\\nThe food - wow. Started with a caviar and crab dish. It was amazing. We started dinner close to 11 pm so didnt have time to do the 16 course tasting menu... must come back for this. I ordered the salmon tartar. Presentation was stunning and tasted very very good.  I had the duck and foie gras for my main course and it was by far the best duck I have ever had. Combining it with the fruit and foie gras made the dish amazing.  For dessert, we ordered the chocolate souffle, some apple or pear dish and then they sent out another dessert (pineapple I think?) because it had taken a while to seat us. Again, all were amazing. But separate from the actual courses, I would have been content with the bread and chocolate cart alone! The bread cart was phenomenal...so many good ones (favorites include the milk bread and bacon bread). And then after the dessert, the chocolate cart! Dream come true! There were sooo many different choices the waiter lost me after the 5th thing... I think there were 40 or 50 different types of chocolates, macaroons, marshmellows etc. they make inhouse. I asked him to recommend his favorites and he did a great job of picking (as he had down with the breads).\\nAnd finally, they sent me home with a full bag of chocolate for the next day. They were not at all stingy about how many chocolates I could have that night and gave me a decent number to take home.\\n\\nOverall, couldn't have asked for more. One of the most memorable meals I've ever had and can't wait to return and try the 16 course menu. In the last 2 weeks I've had the opportunity to eat at a lot of great restaurants (Pierre Gagnaire's new place in the Mandarin, Okada, Eleven Madison, Jean George, Le Bernadin, Gilt...) and this was by far the best meal and experience and that is a pretty high bar of competing establishments.

{"_id": 3, "text": "The Great Dane on the square is my go-to place to take people when we are up near the Capitol - here are the reasons why:\\n\\n1) When we have visitors, there are almost always kids. LOTS of kids.  Today we had four adults and six kids.  The downtown Dane has a nice basement area with large tables that is perfect for big parties with children because, not only is there room, it's usually less busy so our rowdy kids won't bother nearly as many people.\\n\\n2) They have a humongous selection of food. If you can't find something you like at The Great Dane, you should probably just stay home. They have everything, including good options for kids and vegetarian meals that are marked with a little carrot to easily identify them.\\n\\n3) Beer is good for you. Especially beer that is not made by a big beverage company.  My favorite is the Crop Circle Wheat, but I'm a wheat beer girl, so anything with wheat makes me happy.\\n\\n4) The food is good. It's not the best food you are going to find in Madison, but it's good.  The Mac and Cheese (which I've probably eaten 10 times) can be really hit or miss. Sometimes it's amazing. Sometimes it needs more sauce.  Today I had the grilled cheese, which is really more of a vegetable sandwich with cheese.  This is the second time I've had this, and it was substantially better than the first.\\n\\nI really don't have anything bad to say about The Great Dane. Our server today seemed a little annoyed at having to serve a giant party of kids 5 and under, but one slightly peeved server does not a bad restaurant make...I think I said that right. ;)  \\n\\nWe will keep coming back to the Dane...it's a bit like a Madison institution at this point. ;)"}

Pretty fast, just a lovely experience. \\n\\nHowever, my sister and I have gotten takeout on several occasions from this Zoe's and the service has been TERRIBLE. We've ordered in advance, told it will take 15 mins or so, show up and are told it will take a different amount of time. All in all, the last time we ordered takeout, my sister ended up waiting an hour total, at least 40 mins of which was spent in the restaurant. WHAT! I just dont understand that type of service for lunch takeout! What is the delay? The DNC isn't here yet, we called ahead, she took her time to drive there and she still spent MORE THAN HER LUNCH BREAK waiting on the food to be prepared! So disappointing.\\n\\nThis treatment is unacceptable. It is not my fault I was told one thing, showed up and then told another thing (wait longer). They could have told me from the beginning, \\\"this will take 1 hour to prepare,\\\" and I would have shown up an hour later. COME ON!!!\\n\\nNOT ONLY THIS! She called to speak to the manager and some girl lied to her saying she was the manager on the phone when she knows from being in the restaurant the manager is a guy (the same girl told her so).

The answer was, \\\"No, we'll find somewhere for you.\\\" Since I could only imagine that this meant standing in a corner, I declined.\\n\\nAfter hearing wonderful things from others, I attempted a second time, and sucessfully made reservations.\\n\\nThey called the day of our reservations to confirm, and then cautioned me to be mindful of the time, because I would only have an hour and a half.\\n\\nAt this point, I should have known better, cancelled the dinner, and gone elsewhere...but, I didn't...I know, clearly my fault!\\n\\nThe restaurant is beautiful, the view is nice, decorations very homey and sophsicated at the same time.\\n\\nWe ordered the stuffed quail and pate for appetizers. \\n\\nThe stuffed quail was wonderful, one of the best things I've eaten anywhere...and is the primary reason for 2 stars!\\n\\nThe pate baffled me...why serve 3 icecream scoop sized lumps of pate with three tiny toast points is just beyond me. A plate really should make sense...and asking for extra is unnecessary. \\n\\nFor entrees we had the cold pressed duck and the lamb chops.\\n\\nThe duck was nicely medium rare, but I usually enjoy a crispy duck skin and this was soggy and bland.\\n\\nThe lamb was barely edible. The chef recommends medium rare, so this is how I ordered it. It came more than well done. When asked, I did show the waiter (and later the manager) the meat, they saw it was obviously over done. Of course they apologized and offered to re-fire...it was then that I told them of our 1 1/2 hour time limit, and I didn't want to get kicked off of the table!!! \\n\\nMore apologies, they were very sorry...the manager said she had no idea how the time limit thing happened...but would definitely address the situation.\\n\\nDessert was ordered, coffee and donuts. This was a little cup of coffee pudding and 3 beignets...Again, I'm puzzled why a dessert ordered for 2 people had 3 beignets, instead of 2, or 4, which would have made much more sense. But, they were delicious.\\n\\nThe price was above average for Charlotte, and most meals and restaurants in this price range do a much better job.\\n\\nOverall, the quail was spectacular, other things mediocre, and the lamb just awful.

{"_id": 1, "text": "To be fair, let me start off by saying that this place has good food.  The reason it's getting two stars is cuz of the service.\\n\\nMy friends and I went here last nite partly to eat and partly to hear The Samba Project perform.  Well, we get there, it's crowded, there's a line, and I hear the couple in front of us ask the hostess how long the wait will be.  Well, instead of just giving the couple a number, the hostess was all, Well, we just sat, like, a TON of people, so I don't know.  I mean, there's one group that's been here for three hours, so you know....   Um...what?  I found that response unprofessional and unnecessary, so I was a little turned off right then.  By the time we get to the hostess, she gives us the same spiel and has us wait by the bar area (VERY little).  Luckily, the restaurant decided to open up its gates, so there was a LITTLE patio area to hang out at until our table was ready.\\n\\nSo, we're called probably an hour or so later, and we are seated...with no menus except the one we grabbed from the hostess when we went to wait at the bar.  John, our waiter, shows up and was all, Can I get you more drinks?  Um...sure.  But more importantly, can you grab us some more menus and take our food order?  We're hungry!!!  Not so much the case, though.  Instead, he proceeds to try and figure out who is on what tab and what tab needs to be closed at the bar, but really, there were only two tabs going: Mary and Matt's.  So John goes to close the tabs and returns with one receipt, asking, I'm sorry.  What was your name again?  Pat?  No, John.  MATT.  How did you forget in two seconds?  Then, he asks about drinks, and a few of us order iced teas.  John never mentions that they are sweetened and flavored peach, so some of them had to be returned.  Yet, upon taking those drinks away, he never asked about getting us something else to replace the drinks that some of us didn't like.  After finally taking our food order, we had to wait another 45 minutes to get our food: a few paninis with chips on the side and an order of bruschetta.  And we got that only after asking John where our food was.  He never came back to ask about more drinks or to refill waters, and I'm pretty sure that we probably could've walked out of there without having paid, and no one would have noticed.\\n\\nThe food was good, though, thank goodness.  I ordered the Chevito panini (flank steak with cheese, peppers, onions).  The bread was nice and toasted, and the inners really complemented the bread and the chips that came as a side.  The $10 price tag was also really do-able.  Note: You get a surprisingly filling portion of food, so go semi-hungry.\\n\\nThough I didn't eat any bruschetta, it looked amazing.  You can choose from three different kinds off the menu of eight or nine, and those are also of a pretty big size.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere is nice, the food is good, the prices are good.  The service is as if they don't know what to do or are overwhelmed with a lot of customers, the waitstaff don't really wait on you, and also a negative to note: the parking lot is way too small for the place.  \\n\\nI would probably go again for the food and atmosphere, but I'd really have to consider what day and what time cuz the staff is just....in need of help."}

But look closer and there were handprints on the window....dirt on the floor...and in the gym...I saw a piece of a rotting carrot on the side of the machine I was riding over THREE days.  No one ever cleaned up. \\n\\n\\nAt the elevator, on one of two buttons you push to go up or down from my floor...it had some sort of 'spooge' on it.  (this is Vegas..it could be anything). (so I didn't look that closely) but what I did notice was that the 'whatever it was' sat there for THREE days. The elevator button plate was silver/metal and was so clear as day to anyone with a mop, broom or dust rag...to see, wipe or clean.  Nope.  \\n\\nAll that made me do was notice just how 'dirty' the place was.  Again.  The \\\"Place\\\" building where I stayed was built less than 10 years ago and from the surface it looked okay- it looked good.  But look closer....you won't want to look again.\\n\\nIf they pay staff to upkeep the cleaning details...they need to be fired yesterday. EVERYWHERE I looked, in the restrooms, the bars, the pool.  Same thing.  Dirt. Dirty. I was afraid to touch anything.  No one has wiped anything down in days, weeks...Years?  I don't want to know or find out.  \\n\\nI'm sure the staff there know how bad it is too...as upon check in there were three people behind the desk.  No one of them was smiling.  Horrible first impression.  When our turn was next, I wasn't even greeted with a smile.  And...well..it wasn't even a snobby attitude.  It was an \\\"I hate my job...this place is horrible...and I don't want to be working here\\\" type of non-smile. \\n\\nSo why then would you want to spend $ and stay there?\\n\\nWe stayed off the strip because we wanted to have a bigger room with more 'peace' and all we found was filth.\\n\\nSo sad.  It could be such a wonderful place.   Smile at the customers....they have a choice of where to stay in Vegas....a few smiles and making customers feel important and anyone would come back in a heartbeat...oh wait...only if they take care of that 'spooge.'  (to this day I can still see it clear as day!)  And I'm not even that freaky about things like this. It was just that obvious.\\n\\nSo if you have a choice to stay in Vegas, avoid Palms Palace.

If you want to see lines, go to Intelligentsia during the midday rush and you will immediately appreciate what Cartel is doing.\\n\\nFor serving the entire ASU community with outstanding coffee, 20 minutes sounds about right. For a drink that is delicately crafted from bean to cup, $2.50-$4.50 is just right. For a locally owned company successfully competing with corporate giants, you might as well just go and give a deserving shop your money. \\n\\nAnd if you are nervous about being judged by the \\\"hip\\\" kids who look like they smelled a fart, recognize that they are only posing with their macbooks and modern literature and are too vain to break character. \\nAnd if you are nervous about being judged by the baristas, try SMILING at the people who are SERVING you - because you remember how hard it was to deal with customers before you got your middle management salaried job, right?\\n\\nI love you, Cartel."}

Both bartenders were very good at bar tending. However ( and this is the reason it didn't get an extra star), the drink prices are crazy. A fu fu drink for the wife, and a red bull and vodka was $36. Yeah, I typed that right. $20 for the fu fu, and $16 for the RB and Vodka. Not a good way to start the night. At least the drinks were strong.\\n After I paid, and once the blood pressure went down, I started to enjoy it there. I didn't gamble there at the few tables they had ( this minimums at the tables were high too).\\nMusic was current dance music. The view was amazing, and the bunnies attitudes were ok. However, there wasn't an abundance of bunnies. I think 2 or 3 more on staff would be beneficial. \\nOh, and make sure you wear comfy shoes. No sitting unless you want to pay for table service. I don't know how much it was to rent the company of the bunnies, but I saw 1 plastered dude who was paying enough to have 2 bunny dates for the evening.\\nAt 1 point, 2 knockout girls started dancing on the go go stages.\\nHoly shit they were hot, and wearing next to nothing.

Never had a problem with quality or value for price.  I personally love the pastrami burger and country omelette. The place reminds me of the counter service diners I've been to in downtown Chicago in many ways (anyone reading this old enough to remember the \\\"cheeseburger\\\"sketch on SNL??).\\n\\nHOWEVER- Service is something that could improve. They seem to go through staff like paper towels. I think that may be part of the issue and its a sign of a core issue in management/ownership. Ordering at counter is usually not a bad experience, but I have to agree, that Jim's wife is not a warm and fuzzy person.  I have been working in service for the last 30 years and I wouldn't have lasted that long if I I wasn't welcoming and accommodating to my  guests.  I don't frequent another area diner at Greenway and Reems for that very reason- poor customer service. \\n\\n Yesterday was my worst experience there ever.  It was very busy, which you would expect for 10AM Saturday.  My 7 year old son really wanted to have breakfast there, so despite the crowd, we ordered.  Every table was full and most were waiting for orders..  I figured it would be a wait, but maybe only 10 minutes longer than usual.  I was mistaken, It took  almost 1 hour from the time we ordered until our food came.  This was breakfast.  Quick and easy to prepare. 1 Hour????  When our food did arrive, nothing was wrong with it, but our server, was obviously pushed to her limits (only 2 servers working that morning).  She forgot syrup for my sons pancake and I had to get up and get.  No one behind the counter even apologized , even though I was obviously put off I had to get my own condiments.  The water I ordered from her never came either.  Very poor service to say the least.\\n\\nI understand, bad days happen at every job, but maybe they could have been proactive at the counter and let people know how long the wait time for food was going to be?  Since you pay in advance here, its difficult to get a refund.  And then last night on Facebook, instead of posting an apology to their loyal (an inconvenienced) customers, they posted marketing pictures of their food.  Really??  Maybe an apology with an offer to bring in your breakfast receipt for a discount on a return visit would have been a better idea?\\n\\nWe will return, but you're on final notice with us Jim's.

Has somewhat of a hippy look. She needs to be trained IMMEDIATELY. She's beyond unprofessional and her staff is following suit. The bus boy cleaning tables hated his job. He was so slow doing his job and would throw things around. The waitresses were more interested in conversation with each other than servicing their customers.  We were sitting for a good 10-15 min before someone took our drink order. The \\\"manager\\\" told a waitress to get our drinks.

Alas, it is not to be.\\n\\nIn spite of many available tables, we were seated in a dark and cavernous (all in black) alcove.  Although elsewhere it was the bright light of day, we were barely able to make out the menu in the darkness.  We ordered wine by the glass to start; they waved the bottle over the glass and delivered a very small quantity for a full price pour.  Actually, I like the option of small-glass, but only if they offer the option of paying accordingly...I've had larger pours at free wine tastings around town.  Illinois is beer country, and as they are going local perhaps we would have been better to order a local brew.\\n\\nWe waited a long time for our food, allowing our meager splash of wine to warm in the glass so as to save the few swallows to have with our meal.  At long last when it arrived, the spouse's was pleasant enough but mine was not at all as described.  I had ordered the chicken salad on wheat bread with greens; one of the few sandwiches that did not say it was served with chips. All flavors were erased by a thick layer of Dijon mustard and it was served on very dried out toast with chips on the side.  The \\\"greens\\\" were a piece of lettuce inserted between the mass of mustard and the dried out bread.  The person at the next table ordered the same dish and had the same impression, asking the waitress where the greens were and commenting on the dried out toast. It was supposed to have tarragon and other interesting ingredients, but every flavor was eclipsed by the strong Dijon mustard.\\n\\nDon't know if it was the worst lunch I had since moving here last summer, but it was clearly the most expensive bad lunch I have had, approaching $50 for two sandwiches--one nearly inedible--and a smidgeon of wine. This was very expensive for mixed quality, not a good value.\\n\\nPluses: I like that they are trying to source from local farms, although I missed having a fish or seafood option on the menu.  The staff was very friendly. \\n\\nMinuses: Expensive, very small portions, descriptions on menu not accurate, food quality uneven, some bad seating locations.  \\n\\nI gave it two stars for the effort to source locally and the friendliness of the staff.

Hard to believe but it had more seafood than she could eat!  Both items we had are meal sized.\\n\\nFood is cooked right at the counter using small portion sized steam jacketed kettles.  It's a gentle way to cook and very appropriate for the best quality seafood.  The cooking method makes for slow deliberate service but the time spent zooms by watching the cooking and with banter from the chef , server and customers.\\n\\nThis was one of the best meals we've ever eaten.  They have 15 to 20 counter seats only (this is not fine dining, just fine eating) and are open 24 hours a day.  Just another reason you gotta love Vegas."}

The only thing saving them was the nice glaze of viscous basted sauce on them.\\n\\nBeef Brisket: Average. I've had worse (i.e. tough) and I've had better (tender and juicy). These were tender, just kind of bland. I slathered them in the Texas Pit sauce (their medium sauce with peppercorns) to get more of the smoke flavor that should already be inherent in the brisket itself, and was able to down them.\\n\\nChopped Pork: Best of the three meats we tried. Tender and pulled apart easily. Tried it w/ the Georgia mustard sauce. A little bit too much vinegar for my taste, but nice runny consistency. \\n\\nSides: Recommend the cornbread and the corn on the cob. Potato salad was a bit hard (wished they had boiled the potatoes for more than two minutes), and fries just your average steak fries."}

Other women were definitely having a good time, saw some guys getting tipped in hundreds! I'd tip them a buck or two if they passed a tip jar around. It's fun for bachelorette parties for sure, particularly if the bachelorette wants to get up on stage and molested by a muscular man dry humping her doggy style.

Personal preference (and perhaps because I'm a traditionalist) is the tomatoes and mozzarella are sliced so that the can be eaten together - the salad was more of the \\\"cubed\\\" variety, with large chunks of tomato and mozzarella tossed with the shallot and dressing and presented on a plate but not really in an orderly fashion.  Granted, anybody can take pieces and cut them up and stack on a fork to get the medley of flavors together, but that seemed to be a little bit of a miss for me.  More importantly though, were the ingredients.  The mozzarella, while housemade, was good, it was no where near \\\"creamy\\\", rather it tasted almost too firm/dry.  Also, the heirloom tomatoes did not have as much flavor as I expect from heirlooms and were disappointing.  Could have certainly been a bad tomato, but I was hoping for something riper, sweeter, and overall tastier.  \\n\\nEntrees were the short ribs and the duck confit flatbread.  The short ribs have gotten generally good reviews so I was eager to try them, and unfortunately they were average.  While the flavors were good, they were a touch overcooked, because while the meat was soft, there were parts that were dry and a little stringy.  Granted, it was late that we dined and they were probably would have been much better if we got them 1-2 hours prior.  The overall flavor was good (not great).  \\n\\nFinally, the duck confit flatbread was very average.  The duck and portabello mushroom were a good combo and everything (including the Medjool date bbq sauce) tasted very \\\"umami\\\", but the flavors really didn't meld as much as they should have.\\n\\nOverall, the idea is great, but menu and prep need to be refined a little bit for me to go back.  I'm always dumbfounded by 5 star reviews Yelpers give out like Cheerios to toddlers, which means either: a) I'm reviewing the wrong restaurant, b) the experience I had was just an off night (unlikely), or c) the reviewers really don't know what a 5 star restaurant should be.  Who knows.  This place has great potential, just missed the mark in my dining experience."}

While I did like their selection of glasses, the place has less than mediocre service.  The doctor's appointment was fine.  All I wanted to know was if my glasses prescription needed to be increased.  The final bill was for more things than what I needed, which meant I paid for more than what I'd hoped to receive.  Also the glasses I purchased are transition polycarbonate lenses.  Up until a year into it, they were fine.  Since then the transition film has become covered in tiny cracks covering the entirety of both lenses.  Naturally they only guaranteed their work for 1 year.  \\nBeware of the transition lenses from this place.  Do your research first! Transitions Optical, the company that created these lenses that darken in sunlightt, says you should get a certificate of authenticity at the time of purchase and are warrantied by Transitions Optical for two years.  I did not receive a certificate of authenticity.  The multitude of tiny cracks going across my transition lenses make things appear blurry, as if I weren't wearing glasses!   I wouldn't advise doing business here.  Although I still like the frames, I'll get my lenses replaced elsewhere and make sure the customer service is better if I should have problems later!"}

We request the same booth each time, and have yet to have a bad experience... until last night. \\n\\nWe had dinner at 300 East yesterday evening to celebrate my birthday. After being seated, we ordered drinks and my boyfriend let our waiter, Michael, know it was my birthday as he was looking at my ID. The point here is that he knew it was a special occassion.\\n\\nOur appetizer came and was great, however when our meal came my gorgonzola filet was so undercooked that it was actually unappetizing. We waited for Michael to return, however after about ten minutes finally had to walk up to the bar to flag down a waiter to send him over. He did not apologize for the steak coming out raw, but did take it back to the kitchen. Another ten minutes later he returned with my meal. The steak, which was the original one served to me, was now a mangled piece of unedible meat. Tough to cut or chew, and needless to say less than enjoyable. After a bite or two, I had lost my appetitie. \\n\\nWhen he came back to our table, he asked if I was still working on my meal or if I'd like a box. I said no, and before I could even get out that the meal was not up to par and quite frankly inedible, he had walked away with the dish, again with no apology.\\n\\nSadly, we were still charged the $23 for the meal which was the most frustrating part. It's one thing to be served a horrible meal, but another to feel as though the restaurant/waiter does nothing to make it right either by returning with a meal that is as ordered, or after a second attempt removing the item from the bill.. or really even just a simple apology and some sensitivity to the fact that we were here for a special occassion, of which he was fully aware. \\n\\nNeedless to say, the message was received from 300 East that they do not want our business, so we will no longer return to 300 East for our special occassions."}

So here is it... \\n\\nI was passed one of my drinks by a young man who took my money and never gave me a receipt. Not a huge problem, but hey I would like to have it an would have asked him for it had he ever returned. My son and I proceeded to wait. And wait. And wait. I watched the drinks pile up on the counter for the cars behind me. I even saw the drink that my son had been so patiently waiting for as well, all displayed nicely in a row. And still I am waiting. The window was open so I could hear all the lovely witty banter from the staff. They were obviously so lost in conversation that no one bothered to even check on the line of idling cars outside. It took three employees to figure out what I needed in order to complete my order and no one even bothered to apologize. I was shoved a drink in a hurry by a woman who's blouse was unbuttoned well below her apron. Though my eleven year old son got a good chuckle, I was not impressed. I asked for the manager and she replied that it was indeed her. I asked for a number to a district manager and she gave it scribbled on a piece of paper. Still forgetting my receipt. I pulled over in a heated hurry to make that phone call...and would you know it?! It was disconnected. She gave me the WRONG NUMBER. So I went BACK. I asked for my receipt and the correct number. This time the number worked when I dialed it and guess who is on the other line?! THE GIRL WHO GAVE IT TO ME. Please understand that I was rather confused that she not only forgot her own number in the first place, but that she routed me back to herself of all people.

I first had to check in with the front desk as they had already gotten my insurance information over the phone from me and called my insurance for my benefits.  When I went up to the front desk, they told me that I had already met my deductible and that my payments would be 18.00 each visit. The first visit went pretty well, Lee evaluated me so that I could be put on a program.  The second visit was different.  The women therapists like to chat a lot.  They seem to be more involved in what each of them had done over the weekend than what was going on with the patient.  Even though a routine had been planned for me, they rarely followed it.  I would stand around in between exercises waiting for them to finish their conversations.  They acted like I should know everything and on what setting I should do every exercise after just the first visit.  They NEVER watched me do my exercises to make sure that I was doing them right.  I would have to tell them that it hurts and I can't do this.  This happened each and every week, 2 times a week.  One day they heard that the owner was coming.  Boy did they get busy then.  Lee decided that I wasn't making much progress and recommended that I allow him to adjust my neck.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  I told him that Dr. Fitzpatrick, the first neurologist that evaluated me, told me that I was never to have another adjustment of any kind because of the 5 deteriorated discs in my neck, C3, C4, C5, C6 and C7 as it could be very dangerous.  I brought my MRI for Lee to see.  I didn't feel that they took me very seriously, I guess they think they know better than Barrows.  I paid my 18.00 each visit thinking each time that it wasn't even worth that.  I stopped going after 11 visits.  Then I received a phone call from their billing department in Georgia?? telling me that my insurance did not pay as I had NOT met my deductible yet.  What???  They told me that I now owe over 600.00!!  Not for this unprofessional service!  18.00 was too much!  I have since had surgery on my right rotator cuff for torn rotator cuff, bicep tendon torn 90%, torn sub scapula tendon and two others that were torn.  I have every color twine, 2 titanium anchors and 2 plastic anchors in my shoulder.  My left shoulder is just as bad and I am scheduled for surgery on June 28th.  I guess that if they were watching me do my exercises, they have noticed!!!  After my surgery I went to Dynamic Rehab off of Higley Rd by Banner Hospital.  They are absolutely great!!  They are professional and they WATCH me!  They can tell when I am not carrying myself right and where the problem is.  Again they observe and help!  I cannot stress enough the unprofessionalism of Tobler Physical Therapy and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.  What a joke!  I told my neurologist Dr. Yeung and he said he wouldn't pay either.

My friend have told me that they had the best Italian food in this restaurant.  We ordered some drinks and they brought over some bread.\\n\\nBread was stale.  It came with a house made pesto.  I like dipping the bread in marinara so we ordered the appetizer meatballs.  The sauce was great and the temperature was perfect but the meatballs was only warm.  Very disappointing.

I think if they would have used the same sauce on the meatball as they did for the Pasta with lobster and shrimp, it would have tasted better. They have two different types of marinara sauce?  The pasta was hard in a not so al dente way.  Meaning the spaghetti with lobster and shrimp for 44 dollars was probably left under a food heating lamp a little too long and the lobster and shrimp were a little rubbery.\\n.\\nThe whole meal lasted 1:45 minutes.  We sat near the bar and not in the main dining area so that we can watch the lakers game.  I have heard that this was a great restaurant.  The service was the only thing that gave them the extra star.\\n\\nFor the price that you pay here............the food should be a lot better."}

{"_id": 4, "text": "This review is based solely on the atmosphere, service, margaritas and chips and salsa. While walking through Aria looking for a bar to get a drink at we stumbled upon Javier's. There was plenty of open seats at the bar so we took two of them. The bar itself seems to be the centerpiece of the restaurant with a huge tent-like feel made of ropes. It was pretty cool. We got a drink menu right away and there were at least a dozen different margaritas to choose from. Real margaritas with fresh ingredients, good tequila and on the rocks (the only way). My wife had a pineapple margarita which was very good and not too sweet. I had their house margarita which was very good. The fresh squeezed limed juice gave it a great tangy and refreshing taste. It wasn't sweet at all which I enjoyed. It was just pure awesomeness.\\n\\nWhat put this place over the top for me was their amazing chips and salsa. The chips were hot from the fryer (or oven to warm them) and not greasy at all. The salsa was probably the best I've ever had. Spicy, fresh and just chunky enough. It coated the chips perfectly. This is a big deal for me because I live in an area where Mexican food is about as good as you're going to get it outside of Mexico.\\n\\nI could see how this place would turn into a loud tequila drinking college fest quite quickly late at night. I wouldn't make a trip here during late night hours."}
{"_id": 2, "text": "I was looking for a slightly more economical place for dinner, in the vicinity of the Marriott, and happened to come across this place, also a very short walk from the stadium where the Canadiens were playing the first game of the conference finals. Don't let the name fool you. The food is traditional pub fare, but the atmosphere is definitely early-twenties. They have large screens conveniently placed so that you can catch a game from literally any seat, which was nice, but during commercials, they jacked up the rap music, which was highly annoying.\\n\\nIt's pretty clean, and wide enough to navigate in. After waiting a little bit to get noticed, I just grabbed the table closest to the door. Service was so-so, they're nice enough, but when my beer's gone, I shouldn't have to send up a flare for another one, and while they had a decent crowd during the game, they weren't overwhelmed by any means. It's okay when your staff schmoozes with the clientele, but it shouldn't be at the expense of other, thirsty customers. I chose to eat inside to watch the game and get away from all the obnoxious cigarette hounds outside (they have tables on the curb, like a lot of Montreal joints).\\n\\nI had the Cajun salmon. Their definition of \\\"cajun\\\" means blackened to the point of being dry, with just the slightest hint of spice, but not terrible. The rice was completely tasteless, but luckily it came with grilled peppers, mushrooms, and onions. The salad was a pain in the ass, large and leafy and stuffed into a small bowl. Almost impossible to eat without it spilling onto the table. But overall the food was probably the best pub food I had of all the places I've hit in the last few weeks.\\n\\nSince it's a lower-priced place in an otherwise expensive area, I guess you get what you pay for. Their whiskey list is impressive, but given the tiny shots they serve, not worth it. Their \\\"trufflicious\\\" cake was, well, just chocolate cake. Overall, it wasn't bad for the price, but it's not a place to impress a date with the food or atmosphere. \\n\\nI will say, it was good enough that I will give it a second shot next time in town."}

Waiter- sorry we don't have Guinness but 7-11 next door probably does,  he was laughing in jest and it was so unexpected we were too...  it quickly became the theme as my father in-law ordered a Pacifico and was told the same and my brother ordered a Coors Light and was also told the same..  flipping Coors Light right?  that is everywhere..  I ordered a Gin and Tonic and was told they had just run out of Tonic..  But 7-11 has some right...??  Why would decent management go to 7-11 and restock those items if they were out?    We all settled for something else and got out of there.  The restaurant as well as this hotel are a joke,  and clearly ran in the same management style even if they are possibly owned by different owners- seems \\n\\n2nd day-  they manage to get the base of the toilet cleaned up-  but did nothing at all about the shower curtain or wall of the shower.  The in-room refrigerator dies.\\n\\n3rd day-  they take the shower curtain probably to lauder-  and finally brought it back at 5pm as they must not have clean replacements.

{"_id": 1, "text": "After the success of Slider Trucks, its no surprise that more food trucks popped up. The Japanese inspired food truck delivers in creativity, but needs to work on execution. \\n\\nI went with the #1 Fuku Burger that costs $5. Its your traditional burger of tomatoes, lettuce, and onions, but with pickled garlic and their Fuku sauce. My first bite, I knew I wouldn't be a fan of it. First, the sauce drowned the entire burger, so you really couldn't taste anything else. The burger patty also had something in it, possibly the garlic that just obliterates the pallet where you can't even taste anything anymore. Lastly, they used a lot of salt, and I mean a lot of it. I'm not one to usually ding a place for using MSG or anything else that makes you thirsty, but I never EVER had to drink so much water after eating a meal. 4 full glasses of water last night and as I'm writing this review, drinking even more water. Ridiculous. \\n\\nFor mentioning Yelp, I got the free flavored ice mountain. Mine was really a mountain, I think it was taller than the Stratosphere. Regular price is $3, which is pricey for literally shaved ice and artificial food flavorings. There wasn't anything special about this, but anything cold in the hot Vegas summer would be good. \\n\\nI didn't get a chance to try the garlic fries because they ran out. Forgivable? Yes. However, its not a good sign especially for a grand opening.\\n\\nThe wait time for the food is similar to Slider Truck, but I would say Fuku is slightly faster. For a decent size line, expect a 5 minute wait. Then expect another 10 - 15 minutes for your food. Definitely not a place to grab a quick bite.\\n\\nAgain, I'll say the same thing as I did for Slider Truck as a suggestion for this place. Be considerate about how you communicate with your customers, whether its food shortages, locations, or any important information. Remember that not everyone has access to internet all the time. \\n\\nI give this place credit for being creative, but at the end of the day the food just didn't work. There is a lot of room for improvement and I'm willing to try this place again in the future if its around my area. Otherwise, its not worth driving and hunting for this place with so many other venerable burger places in town."}

It happened at lunch the other day to me and my friend who was in town on business.  We arrived late in the day to avoid any crowds.  Our experience was a series of missed customer service opportunities throughout the meal.   \\n\\nIt began with two special orders that we placed with our server.  He wrote these requests down and made it clear that he understood what we wanted.  The order gets delivered by someone else.  When the server comes to check on the order, we let him know that both of our orders didn't reflect our requests.  He looks at the plates with a disappointing look and sweeps them away.  He delivers the special requests a few minutes later with his apologies and lets us know his manager is going to come out and \\\"talk\\\" to us.  It sounded more like a threat than an attempt to smooth over the mishap.  The manager comes out and gives a weak apology.  Missed Customer Service Opportunity #1:  He wasn't really interested in explaining what happened to our orders or whether it was an inconvenience.\\n\\nSo I ask myself, who was ultimately responsible for the order, the one delivering it or the server.  The server showed his disappointment and made us think it was the one delivering the order who was at fault.  The restaurant is not busy and they have time to make sure orders get out correctly.  Where is the quality control that I see on \\\"Hells Kitchen\\\"?  Restaurants can't afford to get it wrong these days.  \\n\\nShortly after the entrees were delivered, our order for French fries made it to the table.  Anyone looking at the plate of fries would have noticed that they were overly salted.  We were busy talking so we didn't notice at first.  After a few bites, we both began to feel the burn in our lips from the salt.  Frustrated that they don't really care, we just didn't eat them.   Missed Customer Service Opportunity #2 :  The server never came back to check on the quality of the French fries.  Worse yet, he should have seen that they were overly salted.\\n\\nWe finish our meals and I request a doggie bag for my leftovers.  The server brings out a container and bag.  I asked my friend, why don't they bag the leftovers anymore?  I noticed that this is a service they no longer provide at many restaurants.  Are they concerned about contaminating my food?  They just served my meal so I don't think that's the case.  Are they too busy?

The Italian Chopped salad balances proscuitto, bacon, egg, with Gorgonzola and provolone cheeses with iceberg lettuce so deftly that the thin-sliced grilled chicken breast on top seems unncessary. \\n\\nChicken and seafood are clearly the strengths here (though they also make their own fresh pastas)...particularly the Roasted Herb chicken, a half-bird rotisseried with rosemary over white oak and nothing less than tender, savory perfection. \\n\\nBut the pizzas deserve equal attention, especially considering how few and far between are good pies found in the city.

No excuses on this one.\\n\\n\\n Places like this, who could even possibly do this to their customers, or fail to deliver in this fashion, there should be a law against this, this was just wrong, beware people, on just principle I would say this place in not worthy of ones business, after this incident, I am left speechless, it caused soo much stress and heartache, unbelievable..."}
{"_id": 1, "text": "I'm a huge fan of Steak n Shake's happy hour which is from 2-4 am and pm on weekdays.  They have half price shakes and drinks, which is a really good deal.  Unfortunately, this particular steak n shake can't make a good milkshake.  They always taste odd here (too much syrup or poorly blended?).  I've been here at least 3 times, and they're always bad.  So, now to satisfy my cravings I tend to drive up to the prospect one.  \\n\\nThe food, on the other hand, is usually about your average steak n shake fare, so long as you stay away from the shakes, you might enjoy your experience (but who really would want to go to steak n shake and not get a shake?)."}

For prices in that range with this atmosphere, it's appalling that they serve drinks in plastic party cups, and soda comes in a can.... No refills. Seriously. The food... Meh. I've had better for half the price... Actually a third of the price. Just because they were featured on food network, doesn't mean it's worth going to. In fact... Restaurants PAY THOUSANDS to shows like DD&D just to be featured."}

Their beer selection is actually pretty solid, and from what I hear the wine list is good too.  3 of us came for non happy hour, we had 5 drinks, beef skewers, crab stuffed red peppers, some spicy shrimp and their bread with crack-sprinkled dipping sauce, all for $60 plus tip.

The food isn't terrible when they actually make what you ask ( I have asked for no olives on my salads 3 times, and always end up with olives) but it certainly isn't worth the price, or the time it takes.

It wasn't very busy but it was a little on the warm side and if I lived in the Las Vegas Valley, I'd be out on the lake cooling off.\\n\\nAnyway, I opted for the Pad See Oew and I asked for Thai spicy. She didn't understand my request and asked me for a spice level from 1-10. I told her a 9 or 10. When my dish arrived, I was excited because it was steaming hot and it looked to be spicy as I could see the pepper flakes on the noodles and even on the vegetables. \\n\\nBut it wasn't. That was a big disappointment for me because I wanted and I asked for really hot. Either they didn't feel like I could handle it or they just don't make it Thai spicy. Otherwise, the food as far as taste goes - was ok. It wasn't bad and I actually finished off the entire dish. But it wasn't so good that I'll make a trip out to Henderson to order that same dish again. \\n\\nDecent prices overall. Decent service as well. My mom really appreciated how they packaged up her to go container with the left over Mongolian Beef and white rice she didn't finish. They actually separated the two selections using foil in the same container. Attention to details like that got them the third star for me."}

I was hoping that I could make a reservation on the patio, but it's first-come first serve, and I was not willing to wait for 2 hours.  They seated us at an indoor table right next the window, so that we could still see the Bellagio fountains.  The server brought out some couscous, compliments of the chef, and freshly baked french bread and butter.  I feel a little guilty for having my boyfriend sitting across from me because I have to say that I was in love with the butter.  I ordered the house salad and my bf ordered the french onion soup.  I was really surprised by their large portions because I was expecting it to be smaller.  Then our entrees came, I got the steak au pouvre and the bf got the steak with onions.  My heart was all aflutter when I saw what was on my plate.  A large platter which was half covered with a thin steak and frites.  The steak was flavorful and cooked to a perfect medium.  The frites were amazing, like strips of freshly cooked potato chips.  So like total gluttons, we inhaled our dinner.  As for dessert, we couldn't do it, we had eaten too much.  What made my bf very happy, which I think any water drinker would appreciate, was that his water glass was always filled without ever having to search for someone to refill it.

{"_id": 2, "text": "So somewhere in the center of the corporate bagel universe the baker demigods got together and decided that some bagel chains would be better priced for bagels with just a basic spread- like cream cheese or peanut butter, while others would get the price break for bagels with, aka the breakfast sandwich.  Why else would a some bagel shops charge $1.50 for the bagel with spread, while the others go for $2.00 plus?  And still others charge $4.00 for a bagel with egg and cheese, while other do it for $2.00?\\n\\nBrueggers, as a chain, was blessed with the breakfast sandwich advantage, and they do it well.  Not only can you get an egg o'bagel for under $3.00, but you can also add spinach, mushrooms, and other fresh veggies to it for just a few shekels more.  This is not possible at your other corporate bagel stops.  If a bagel with a spread won't do, Bruegger's is a better bet.  \\n\\nAdd to that the fact that this store is just a doorway away from a Carribou's Coffee and this is breakfast made in heaven.  Sadly, though, I am not alone in this assessment as both sides can be quite full on weekend mornings.  This even holds true for the outside patio tables during warmer weather, where people watching is at a premium.  Sadly this can making parking a challenge too, though CMC's lot next door has helped out.\\n\\nThe other challenge is, as mentioned by others, cleanliness of the place.  Staff are apparently too busy serving new customers and ringing them up, as late mornings look something like a post-locust plague landscape in terms of trash and spills left along table tops.  A little gross, but easy to fix.\\n\\nWeekday mornings can be just as tricky with parking, but folks are so much sitting around and drinking in the morning.  Great deal on a baker's dozen bagels on Wednesdays, which always makes you popular back in the office."}

I have been here twice, once with 2 girlfriends for brunch and another time with my boyfriend. The first time I went, I ordered the pear salad, which was decent and my 2 friends ordered scones. One of my friends got her scone almost immediately and the waitress completely forgot about the other one. When she finally remember, she apologized profusely, which was nice but probably shouldn't have happened since there was already one scone ordered for the table. Fine, no biggie, that I can get over. \\n\\nThe second time I dined here there were quite a few issues. 1. We sat at our table for a while before we were even acknowledged by anyone to get a glass of water. 2. There was a lady on her cell phone the entire hour we were at the restaurant, even though it blatantly says on the menu \\\"Please don't use cell phones or laptops in the restaurant\\\" (I know this isn't the restaurant's fault, but if you are going to call attention to it on your menu, you better be prepared to follow through if someone isn't following orders.) 3. I saw posted on their twitter account the day before that they had a special for brunch that included their potato croquettes. My boyfriend ordered the eggs & bacon (they were out of ham) which comes with the croquette. When the waitress (same one as last time) brought his food out she said their fryer was broken so they couldn't serve the croquette and substituted with a salad, which I'm pretty sure she knew BEFORE he placed the order. She should have mentioned this beforehand. And I'm pretty sure you can fry a croquette in a pan. 4. My sandwich sat on the kitchen counter waiting to be picked up for about 5-10 minutes, our waitress walked by it about a dozen times without even glancing in that general direction but came over to ask if we needed anything. My boyfriend, not being able to hold back said 'yeah, we'll take her sandwich that has been sitting over there forever.' Not the nicest thing to say, but we were so over it at that point. \\n\\nEvery time our waitress opened her mouth, she was apologizing for something and making excuses (\\\"it's been crazy in here today\\\"), regardless of who she was talking to in the restaurant.

They're putting them out though- it's on purpose. Dress pretty, as all ladies should try in Vegas, and the cook might hand you some freshly chucked ones!\\n\\nThe sweet potato fries- omg soo good! I usually don't care for these type of fries, but these are coated with roasted sesame seeds and ginger honey (I believe) and it takes it to another level!\\n\\nYum mochi, macarons, and an array of unique flavors of ice cream for dessert! You can also ask them to make you fresh crepe and strawberry dipped chocolate!\\n\\nPresentation on the foods are lovely. Ambience is modern, clean and very pretty. It's next to the pools, and the windows give off a beautiful natural lighting.\\n\\nTips: Dinner is at 3PM. Come at least 45 minutes before (waiting in line took us 30 min) that time so you can pay the lunch fee instead of dinner fee. We were late because we hung out too long at MGM pool.

There were some other small-batch brews that are apparently exclusive to Four Peaks locations. As I used a couple pints to wash down a dry, mediocre meal, I realized what my problem was. The beer is such a reliable selling point, it doesn't seem like anyone arranging the menu really tries. This is the southwest. This is a brewery known for taking risks with novel flavors. The menu should reflect that more, and not just coast on mediocre grub. Fries were rock hard. Burger was ok. \\n\\nOverall, our servers were so chill I enjoyed my lunch here.

I then talked to corporate; they tried to help, but had me talk to the store manager. The manager didn't really listen to my complaint and refused to help or come up with a reasonable solution. Once again I called corporate for help, and was dumped back to the store. However, this time I spoke to the most appalling depiction of a customer service rep (Greg). After telling me what happened, arguing with me and refusing to even simply listen to my story, he caused me to escalate. This employee should never be allowed to answer any phone call; I am now considering the value of my Sprint service because of him. I would rather pay more money to another company, than know that a piece of my bill can support such a dreadful employee. In the end, a supervisor at corporate was able to come up with a simple solution to my problem. After spending 3-5 hours of my time to get this figured out when it could have resolved at the store in 30minutes....

This first encounter with Texas Roadhouse yielded the following opinions:\\n\\nTexas Roadhouse is the American Cowboy version of the Aussie Outback.  Lots of similarities.\\nOutback is, however, more flavorful.\\nThe sweet potato has more sugar, but is somehow less sweet.  Still tasty though!\\nI could do without the prime rib in the future.\\n\\nWe were seated very quickly, despite the busy night.  It was almost too quickly... half our party was on the way to the table while the other was still trying to get through the front door.  Service was pleasant but brief, also due to the busy night.  There were several birthdays in the house, as evidenced by the echoing \\\"YeeHaw!\\\"s every so often.  Our small party ordered very similar meals to what we're accustomed to at Outback, and that was probably a mistake.  I shouldn't have put Outback expectations on Texas.  The salad was a perfectly fine side salad, the veggies looked standard, and the mashed potatoes had good flavor.  I enjoyed my sweet potato topped with toasted marshmallows, and felt only a little guilty about it.  The prime rib however tasted like ham.  I don't actually like ham, nor did I order it, so I wasn't pleased with the taste in my beef.  I think it was slightly overcooked from my requested medium-rare, but it was tender enough I wasn't too upset.  \\n\\nI would return to Texas Roadhouse if I was in the area, and I'd order sirloin.

{"_id": 2, "text": "My wife and I have stayed at this hotel maybe 4-5 times, and at the Cabana suites twice. (Cabana review on their separate yelp page.)\\n\\nFor the main hotel, we've stayed at both the Tower rooms and the original rooms. The over-arching feeling I have, is that this place is really cool. You HAVE to appreciate the Cortez being one of the last of the original hotels/casinos in Vegas. If your into that more than anything, stay in the original rooms. Your room will have a tiny hint of years of nicotine, and a slightly audible sound track of all the action down stairs. (Especially in the bathroom.)\\n\\nPersonally, we're a little less keen on the smoke and noise; so the tower rooms fit the bill. Relatively new, well done decor, kind of reasonable prices for room service; and okay service. The shower has a small window that you can open if you like, which I found extremely nice/interesting. (Others might not.)\\n\\nThe Cafe has ALWAYS been a favorite. The food is actually REALLY good and has some of the most reasonable prices in Vegas. Service has always been really sh*tty, so just be prepared. If the cafe had a personality, it would be like Rainman's other talent was cuisine. The food is really good, but then the rest of the experience is enough to make you roll your eyes. Here's the formula: when you sit down, wait 5-7 minutes for your order to be taken, then wait 12 minutes. When your food arrives, they slap down your check, and aren't to be seen again. Really guys? (One last rip on the cafe service... if they had Keno runners, they'd probably make more money off of me. That would be nice.)"}

I needed a gel mani, but was looking forward to getting a pedi if time permitted (it did not). I spent an hour and a half at the salon, and my nails have never looked worse after a visit to a salon. \\n\\nWhen I walked in, I was immediately greeted and asked to pick out a gel nail color from their wall. There was a decent selection of colors in a few different brands, I was happy with them. Agreeing with another reviewer, the smell coming in was a little overwhelming, but I'm generally used to the smell of a busy nail salon. \\n\\nI told the gentleman doing my nails that I'd like the white french manicure in the gel polish and he immediately went to work removing the old gel from my fingernails. I was very happy with how he cleaned my nail beds, he was very precise in pushing and trimming my cuticles, I was surprised that he didn't ask if I liked my nails squared off (I do) but I was okay that they were a little rounded off. I told him I liked my white tips somewhat thick, and it wasn't until after he started polishing on the white tips that my experience went downhill. He layered on the white very thinly, I told him a total of 4 times that I like my white thicker. I told another manicurist, and she was able to tell him (apparently he didn't speak English). It took a final 10 minutes to dry my top coat (it only takes 2-3 at my old salon). In the end, my manicure came out lopsided, there were bubbles at the surface, and a small black speck in the gel on one of my nails. \\n\\nUpon checking out, the manager asked how things were and I told him that they weren't great, very sloppy. He told me to come back in a few days to re-do them. When I told him that I wasn't planning on coming back, he told me they could squeeze me in right then. Who has 3 hours to get a manicure?!\\n\\nPROS:\\nNice front desk staff.\\nDecent prices ($25 for a gel mani, $5 extra for french tips).\\nMeticulous cuticle trimming.\\n\\nCONS:\\nAcetone smell more prominent than most other salons.\\nTakes longer than other salons (1.5 hours for a gel mani).\\nUneven french tips, bubbles in my top coat, SLOPPY.\\nSome manicurists don't speak English and will ignore your requests.\\nWasn't ever asked what I prefer (round v square, thickness of french tip, etc.)\\nWas never offered water (something I like about other salons.\\n\\nDefinitely will not be back, and wouldn't recommend to friends or family. :("}

I thought my sweet potato fries were over cooked but still ok. I liked the signature salad but I think it might be too spicy for some people as it had lots of spicy pickled peppers in it. My two toppings were onion rings and queso fundido and both were tasty.\\n\\nMy husband got the South Western Burger requested Medium Rare. That burger also came out Medium Well.

So I turned around and was watching our waitress watching TV in the bar and made eye contact. Soon she runs over and ask how things are. My husband shows her his burger and agrees that the burger isn't medium rare and offers to make him a new one. He already ate half of the burger and at this point doesn't want another burger. \\n\\nThey did take his burger off our bill and that was good on RBB's part but still doesn't change the fact that they served us over cooked burgers.\\n\\nThis should be a 4-5 star review as tasty as the food really was but the execution was too far off to give 4 stars.\\n\\n I thought the food was good enough that I will go back and try a different burger next time.

My date had an ahi and hamachi tartare, which was bland. \\n\\nI had the King Crab Legs for a main and my hubbie had combo with filet mignon and lobster. We ordered the trio of mash and creamed spinach on the side as the server had recommended 2 sides for 2 people. He must have been upselling as we couldn't even eat one between the 2 of us. \\n\\nThe mains were the better part of the dinner, the crab portion was massive, but really hard to eat. It was served without a shellfish fork or any other tool to get the meat out. It was partially cracked, but not enough to be of use. I also had to ask the server for a wet towel as no finger bowl was brought to the table. The steak, according to hubby was good. The part that was disturbing was the amount of butter in everything, it made it too rich to eat. The potato tasted overwhelmingly of butter, the spinach was a grease slick and we both had butter sauces served with our meal. \\n\\nThe main reason why Rare 120 got 2 stars rather than 3 is the service. Our server was unbelievably bad. \\n\\n1.We were drinking glasses of no doubt expensive bottled water, and the server came and topped up our glasses with tap water. \\n\\n2.

I could eat a whole bag by myself and that's probably what's caused me to diet in the first place :) You can lesson the calorie blow by ordering the kids sized bag of chips. It seems to come with 15-20 chips which is a more waistline friendly portion if you have to have them. \\n\\nIf you want something that satisfying and doesn't kill your diet, try a bowl with no rice or beans but get a scoop of chicken AND Steak. The extra meat really adds to the heartiness of the bowl and it feels like a treat. I also get mild salsa (pico), sour cream, cheese and the guacamole depending on how I'm feeling that day. If its a diet splurge day, I'm adding the sweet corn and tacking on a bag of chips!"}

The excessive chip repair I paid for only covered most chips according to the informative panel on the wall of the shop which they were happy to show me after I showed them the remaining \\\"excessive\\\" chips.

Since I didn't pay for the \\\"deluxe package\\\", I'm stuck with the orange peel paint job.  They took off the emblems and didn't put them back on.

He signed in and was seen withing 5 min.  After finishing my paperwork, I was also seen within 5 min.  I was first seen by the assistant who took digital Xrays.  They were quick and harmless.  She explained a couple things and then I had to wait less than 10 min to see Dr. Eric Lac.  In the meantime they gave me the remote to the tv and actually had expanded cable channels (not movie).  Dr Lac came in and asked some questions, explained some things, examined my teeth then gave them a deep cleaning.  The deep cleaning was simple and painless.  I used to hate this and I had to make an effort to not tense up once I realized this was painless.  After Dr. Lac, the assistant came back in and polished my teeth, also simple and painless.  They gave me a goodie bag and scheduled me for 6 months.\\n\\nImportant details for me personally.  First, I couldn't tell if anyone smoked or not.  I absolutely hate when someone is working close to my face with their face and I have to smell their dying cigarette lungs breathing 5 inches from me.  And the assistant and Dr Lac didn't have foul breathe.  Also really important when visiting a dentist.  Second, the wait time where minimal.  Finally, the staff was pleasant and visit was comfortable.\\n\\nI do recommend this dentist.  I'll be back in 6 months."}

We bought the mattresses last weekend, at which time we were told that we could either pay $100 for delivery or pick them up ourselves from 51st Ave. and Van Buren.  Oh, yes, and the warehouse is only open from noon-5pm Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  Closed entirely Tuesday and Sunday.  I told them that we wouldn't be able to get there until the following week, since we work normal person jobs and can't drive 20 miles in the middle of the workday.  They said that would be fine.  For multiple reasons, today is the day that my husband was able to drive over to pick up our mattresses.  On the way, we dropped off the old mattresses at Goodwill.  I tried to call to confirm everything, but nobody answered the phone.  The voice message clearly stated \\\"12-5 every day but Sunday and Tuesday.\\\" Upon arrival, my husband was informed that they're doing inventory, so they couldn't get anything for customers.  He asked if a manager was present.  Nope.  I called the Tempe store and they told me that there's nothing they can do because it's inventory day and apologized for the inconvenience.  I told them that my husband just drove 20 miles for no reason and my children have no mattresses. She apologized again.  I asked if I could cancel our order over the phone or if I needed to come to the store.  She offered to get her manager, left me on hold for a few minutes, then told me that he was \\\"with someone\\\" and would get back to me.  \\n\\nInterestingly, my husband called ten minutes later to tell me that he had the mattresses.  He'd seen some lady strapping a queen mattress to her car by the loading dock, so he went back inside, looked crazy and asked why she could get a mattress when he couldn't, and they gave him the mattresses.\\n\\nI finally heard from the manager after almost half an hour.  He repeatedly blamed the salesperson for not telling me that the warehouse was doing inventory this week and didn't seem to hear the two times I questioned why the message at the warehouse hadn't been changed so as to head off this situation.  On the up side, they're theoretically crediting my card for $40.  Will not be going back."}

It is also way overpriced for the amount and non quality dishes.\\n\\nTo start we ordered the grilled octopus.  First off it is Not Grilled, it was maybe heated up in a pan. Second, it was smothered in the sauce and mushrooms.  The enoki were mushrooms were good but over took the dish, might as well just make an enoki dish.\\n\\nNext we ordered the 2x fried chicken.  This was over cooked, hard and chewy.   Maybe stick to just 1x fried chicken.\\n\\nNext is the duck leg.  This was actually pretty good.  It was cooked just right so it wasn't dry.\\n\\nNow the crab fried rice. TERRIBLE!!!  This is Japanese style food and they didn't even know how to cook rice!  It was mushy, almost like rice cake. Just plain Bad! They give you about a scoop and a half of this stuff for $24. \\n\\nNext was the NY steak.  You are given 8 pieces that are wrapped in nori and cut like sushi.  The steak was cooked perfectly med well with good flavor.\\n\\nLast main dish is the Logan ramen.  This was more like bad cup o noodle!  The noodles are dried noodles, I swear they opened a package of Top Ramen and used half for this order.  Then the broth was salty, chalky and sour.  The cook obviously has never eaten ramen in his life.  \\n\\nWe ordered green tea to hopefully wash down all this..... Um stuff, I guess you can call it because it wasn't food at all.  Even the tea was terrible!  It was really bitter and rancid.  Seriously tasted like weeds and a sock were in the pot.  The waiter later explained it is some type of jasmine tea. Although there was no scent of jasmine in the tea.\\n\\nNow the dessert.  These 2 were surprisingly palatable.  The fried doughnuts were cooked just right.  The outside had a crispiness to it while the inside was soft.  It was also likely sugared with a hint of ginger.  The second dessert was their homemade soft serve.  This was real good.  It had a chocolate coffee flavor to it with pop rocks.  \\n\\nOverall the service was great! But the food was not good at all and waayyy overpriced even being in a casino.  \\n\\nDefinitely will NOT be coming back here"}

My previous experiences with piercing were at a doctor's office (where my mom took me as a kid), Claire's (gasp!) and of course the Do-It-Yourself Piercing Studio of my college dorm bathroom.  I had no idea what to expect out of a legit piercing place.  Halo impressed me from start to finish, so much so that I'm trying to think of other piercings to get just so I can go back there.  \\n\\nAna did my piercing and her professionalism was beyond outstanding.  She explained everything very thoroughly, from the sanitation processes they use to after-care and everything in between.  I felt very comfortable with her and confident in her abilities.  Unlike the 20-something piercing gun wielding chick at Claire's or my own unsteady hand, Ana has expertise, skill, and passion for her work.  If you want it done right, go to Ana.\\n\\nThis place is spotlessly clean.  You watch them wipe down the chair you sit in.  They give you the marker they use to mark where your piercing will go because they won't re-use them.  \\n\\nThere is a lot of jewelry there, but I like very simple jewelry so I didn't really explore it that much.  I love the diamond and white gold piece for my nose and pretty much never take it out.\\n\\nThe only thing I would offer as a criticism is it takes way too long to do anything there.  It took forever to get my nose done.  I don't want to rush the process and compromise on cleanliness or quality, but there were little things like the checkout process that I thought could be sped up.  I had the same experience when I went with my husband to get his ears done, and then also when I had to go to replace my nose stud because I lost mine after a night of drunken debauchery.  I guess the thing is, don't go in thinking you're just going to get something done and then head home.  It's like the nail salon.  You're gonna have to spend some time there if you want it done right.\\n\\nNow that I write this review I've reaalllly got the itch for a new piercing..."}

{"_id": 1, "text": "I went to wild Thaiger for dinner with three friends and although the service was good in a clean environment, the food was disappointing. The flavors and preparation is just not authentic. I am reviewing the food with the background of having traveled to Thailand and having lived most of my life in larger culturally diverse cities (NY, Chicago, DC) with close authentic thai food. Here are some critiques:\\n\\nPad Kee Mao - My favorite noodle dish of all time is supposed to be prepared with thick rice noodles sauteed to a variety of textures, and infused with a dizzying array of spice. Instead, the dish here is made with thin vermacilli noodles and tasted like a lump of wet ricey dough. I even explicitly asked for it to be extra spicy, but there was barely any.\\n\\nPad thai - This basic Thai staple was presented as a soggy clump of noodles with a watery sauce pooling at the bottom of the plate. The worse part was that despite all of that sauce, it was tasteless except for the peanuts sprinkled on top. There was no hint of tamarind or fish sauce or chili. Disgrace.\\n\\nTom Yum (chicken) - Again, what we received was a flavorless broth. There was no taste of lemongrass, no curry, and the chicken was dry.\\n\\nNeedless to say, this was very disappointing. For a large restaurant in a prominent location, the food served up here was worse than some of the shacks I've eaten out of in other cities.\\n\\nTwo stars for service and cleanliness alone, none for food."}

Initially I was worried that we wouldn't be able to find someone who could really care for 130 pound, Great Dane (Apollo). He's a handful. On top of that, I expect the best when it comes to Apollo's needs and spending my hard earned money. Once I met Tim during (practically the day before our trip), his professionalism eased my worries and he quickly became Apollo's new best friend. I used to be a skeptic when it came to pet sitters and dog walkers, l thought it wasn't worth it. Wrong! It's totally worth it, the feeling of comfort is invaluable. I trust Absolute Pet Care with everything!  \\n\\nEven with a nervous owner, such as myself, Tim knew what to do. My main concern was that Apollo wouldn't adjust to a \\\"stranger\\\" coming inside the house, but I was wrong again! In the free initial assessment, Tim went above and beyond my expectations, spending over an hour and a half getting to know us. Talk about detail-oriented! Beyond his comprehensive knowledge of pet care, Tim is one cool and friendly guy. One thing was blatantly clear from day one - Tim genuinely loves animals. The compassion and flexibility shown while working with a high-maintenance dog like Apollo is why this is my top pet sitting and dog walking service in the east valley. The name of his company says it all, Tim is absolutely the best!\\n\\nWith customized pet care instead of pre-determined prices and set services, I never have to pay extra for things like walks or clean-up should any \\\"accidents\\\" occur. Since Apollo can be unruly on a leash, Tim gave me some tips and used training techniques while walking Apollo without charging extra. No unexpected costs at all. Everything is clearly outlined from start to finish so I know the exact cost ans care tp expect. They leave detailed notes for owners to read upon return, watch over the entire house and take care of all the little details, like mail, packages, etc. Further, each pet sitter is llicensed, bonded and certified. Should any sort of problem occur, I know someone can take care of my dog as well as my house.\\n\\nApollo enjoys spending time with Tim so much that I now use Absolute Pet Care for dog walking during the work week. That feeling of guilt when I have a late night at work or a hectic schedule is gone. There's nothing more I could ask for from a pet sitting company. Yeah, I could pay a little less and go with pet boarding, a kennel, the kid next door, a neighbor or a friend, but these pet sitters are so much more! I know this is a lengthy review, but if your a doggie parent like me, you need details. So if your going to need a pet sitter, you absolutely should contact Absolute Pet Care, especially if you live in the Old Town, Scottsdale or Arcadia areas. Apollo highly recommends it!!"}

Her eyes were so big as we walked in and I couldn't wait to see her amazement at the show and food. \\n\\nI was shocked to see that the kid's chicken lunch was $11 and my chicken and shrimp was $15 on the lunch menu. The entire meal (no alcohol included) was $40. There are so many more affordable tasty options in this area! What a waste!!!\\n\\nNow, part of the bad experience was not entirely the restaurant's fault. There were three spooky teenage boys at our table that were looking for trouble. They were yelling at the staff and being very rude. Part of my review of two stars is because the restaurant never asked them to quiet down or leave. They were yelling at the poor lady that made our food thru the entire meal, \\\"cook it all the way thru. don't put any spices on it. don't burn it!\\\" Then, every few minutes, they would go stand behind people at other tables to watch how their food was prepared. Every protective bone in my body was on guard with these little punks. Why wouldn't the restaurant ask them to leave?\\n\\nSO, the lady that did the tricks was very underwhelming. I am not sure if she was always this way, or just this way because of the spooky boys at our table. Either way, it was a terrible experience and I will not go back there."}

My party of 4 had reservations, but we still had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. Our server brought us glasses of sangria (we didn't even notice at first that sangria came with the restaurant week menu, yay for free drinks!) Their red wine sangria was really good, with a nice star anise flavor. \\n\\nFor restaurant week, you split an appetizer with your dining companion, each had an entree (either 2 tacos or 1 burrito) and share dessert. We started with the taco salad, which was really tasty and spicy. I liked the chipotle ranch dressing and strips of tortilla on the top. \\n\\nI ordered the shrimp and barbacoa beef tacos - it said the beef is braised in Dr. Pepper. Interesting...they were out of shrimp and had to sub fish. The tacos came wrapped in 2 little corn tortillas, but they still fell apart when you pick them up. They were stuffed with things...but overall lacked flavor. I didn't finish either taco. We asked at this point for chips and salsa, which were brought out but horrible. I think we all ate one (burned) chip, with really thick, tomato-ey salsa with no freshness or kick.\\n\\nAt least you can't mess up dessert, right? I think it was a churro, but I wouldn't know because they were out. This happened the first day of restaurant week, about 730pm. They obviously didn't plan for restaurant week very well, because we didn't get dessert or and shrimp tacos. The waitress offered to get us another glass of sangria for dessert, but by this time we wanted to leave. \\n\\nSkip it."}

{"_id": 2, "text": "*Sigh* \\n\\nI can hardly believe it, but I finally ate at Pizzeria Bianco, one of America's most famous and highly rated pizzerias. \\n\\nAfter 5 different and failed attempts to try a slice of Oprah's favorite pizza, I contemplated a plan to get in by calling on behalf of a cancer stricken girl with only a month to live and one dream: To eat at Pizzeria Bianco. \\n\\nInstead, I took someone's advice and made sure I got there early on a Friday night. And when I say early, I mean not early enough because at 3:45pm, there were already 50 people ahead of me. Estimated wait time? 2 hours!!! And did I mention I got there at 3:45pm and his doors don't even open until 5pm? \\n\\n2.5 hours later...to be exact, I was seated. Browsing through the simple menu, I decided to start with the Spiedini. The Italian Fontina cheese wrapped in Prosciutti was a little too rich for me. As for the pizzas-did you catch the plural? I decided to order all 6, yes 6 of the listed pizzas. \\n\\nI figured the chances of me waiting another 3 hours to get into Pizzeria Bianco were slim to none so I better order all of them and get it done! Efficiently, with the help of my BF, we finished 4.5 26\\\" pizzas out of the 6 pizzas in one seating (the Margherita, Marinara, Rosa, Sonny Boy, Biancoverde, and Wise Guy). Told you I could throw down :) The tables beside us were either disgusted or shocked. Out of the 6, my favorite was the Marinara pizza. It stole my heart with its boastful, yet simple flavors of just 3 ingredients-tomato, garlic and oregano. The Rosa was my least favorite because of the overwhelming amount of onions. Being a meat lover, I was disappointed with the protein shakes...I mean pizzas. They were Hoover-daming and drenched with oil. Not sure if they're always like that or if it was just our order? I prefer my pizzas to be moist, not drenched. \\n\\nOverall, Pizzeria Bianco has amazing dough and tasty pizzas. I don't think it lives up to its hype taking into consideration the ridiculous wait time and my hunger pangs. But it IS an experience-to be able to try such a famous restaurant located in our own backyard. I'd return...as long as someone else stands in line. I've already taken one for the team."}

I'm all for having fun, but not at the expense of service. The girl at the window was obviously distracted and handed me only one item I had ordered. When I told her I had ordered another meal, she got snotty with me. She gave me my other order, which still was missing my 4 extra canes sauces. When I again told her that I needed the sauces, she was incredibly rude, asked me to see my receipt and made a big deal about how she hadn't charged me for it even though she had repeated my order back to me at the speaker and definitely included the 4 sauces. She didn't end up charging me, but the whole thing was just ridiculous. I'm extremely disappointed with this whole experience."}

It was sexy, fun, entertaining and sure adult, just enough, perfect. So I took my husband for his birthday (dinner and a show in Vegas, nice ;-). We both left disappointed and with raging headaches. Where was the Cirque in this show? I saw drag, boobs, lewd jokes and minor acro feats. What I missed was the charm, the sensuality and awe that most Cirque shows offer in spades. You can see the aforementioned sexy XXX anywhere in Vegas. My advice to the consumer- decide what you want if it's raunch go elsewhere, if it's Cirque try O. To the Cirque team- try harder to stay on brand and revert back to the show as it was 10 years ago or take your name off this show. Zumanity is not worth the time or money, sorry."}

My fella had dropped his hat off to be dry cleaned, and asked me to pick it up after work.  He told me that when he had dropped it off, that they promised they would be open til 6:30.\\n\\nI pulled up at 6:15, opened the door, and walked in. \\nRather than being greeted, I hear \\\"WE'RE CLOSED!!\\\"\\n\\nOh no you did NOT just yell at me.  \\n\\n\\\"Really?

It hadn't been touched yet.  \\n\\nOk again...not a HUGE deal.  I ask how late are you open, and the guy says \\\"At least...8.\\\" \\n\\nDo you not know your own hours?  At least 8.  That's a new one.  \\n\\nSo when I got off work yesterday, I stopped by, at about 6:20.

What is smash sauce?  I'm pretty sure its mustard, mayo, pickle relish and not sure what else.  It was ok.  The sauteed onions were so hot that a day later my tongue is still burned.  (-1 star for that)  However, I really liked the meat on the burger.  It had great taste and was juicy.\\n\\nMy husband ordered the BBQ, Bacon & Cheese, 1/2 lb. burger.  He said that it was good and would go back.\\n\\nThe fries, called Smash Fries = rosemary, olive oil & garlic.  I could have done without that for sure.  They are different than what you would get anywhere else, but would I order them again?  Probably not.  I also wish they would tell you that the side of fries is enough for sharing (-1 star).  So for two burgers, two fries and two soda's our total was like $21.00.  Not bad at all.\\n\\nThey have something for everyone (burgers, chicken, hot dogs, salads).  You can order online too!\\n\\nSomething that I thought was cool, they have a slightly different menu for each city.  For instance, for Las Vegas, they have a burger called Sin City Smashburger.

The Korean short ribs were just ok, the quality of the meat was not that great. The fried oysters were cold when I got them, and when I tried a fresh batch they cooked it didn't really have any flavor. The mini sloopy joe burgers were pretty good, but I didn't pay this price to eat burgers. The prime rib I got to say was pretty tender and cooked well, but I'm not a huge fan of prime rib so needless to say I wasn't impressed by that either. \\n\\nMoving on to the desserts..the presentation looked all so lovely, but most of the ones in the little tiny cups weren't that great. The flan was pretty good and not too sweet. They had these tiny orange macarons which were pretty yummy. My favorite dessert was the ice cream, which I believe it was the caramel chocolate one I had. The ice cream was rich and creamy and probably by far the best thing I think I had at the buffet. \\n\\nSo I was not impressed by them at all, I essentially paid $40 to eat really really good ice cream, which I could have gotten a whole bucket worth. I still recommend the M Buffet at the M Resort. Their buffet not only includes unlimited Wine and Beer, but their crab legs are Warm!! And all their desserts are yummy, especially the creme brulee."}

{"_id": 0, "text": "Let me start by saying that this is all based on our waiter, Sloan.\\n\\nMy friend and I came here for lunch one day, at a time when the restaurant was not in any means full- maybe like four tables were occupied. Let's get the pros out of the way, since there were only a few:\\n\\nPROS- We both got the veggie burger, which was fantastic. It is made with real veggies and on a bun that is purple. PURPLE! And tastes great. For dessert we got the crepes (Nutella and Smores) and they too were very delicious. But, not even this great feast was enough to make up for crappy service and lackluster surroundings.\\n\\nCONS- Who came up with the idea to cover every inch in tables and chairs, and in such a way that even Janga would be shamed? Seriously, not only was there no room (and I cringe at the idea of how it really would have been with a lot of people in there) but our table was lopsided, and kept rocking back and forth. The hostess who sat us even knew it- she moved it around a bit and said it would be fine. No. It was not.\\n\\nNext up prices; yeah whatever, it's expensive. I get that. 100$ for lunch for two.\\n\\nNow for the main one star review: Sloan, our waiter. Yeah, I remember his name. He was that bad. \\nThe first sign was the fact that we waited 20 minutes for our food to come out, and when it did, the person (who was not our waiter but some random chick) just dropped them off and ran away. Literally ran away. That's ok. Not like I was going to ask for ketchup. Oh wait, I was. So I waited for our actual waiter to come over so I could ask for some sauce. Ten minutes later out of the hole of hell he came up and I started with \\\"Could I get some ranch....\\\" and he turned to walk away. My friend had to yell 'wait' for him to return since she too wanted sauce.\\nNext up, after eating and ordering dessert we waited another 20 minutes, all the while our dinner plates were in front of us and never cleared. Not until the crepes came out did our waiter walk over and clear it off. \\nFinally, the wait time for the check was ridiculous. Not only had we been there for an hour and half already, we had to wait even longer for Sloan to notice us.\\n\\nAnd where was Sloan this entire time? I shit you not, speaking to the bartender. THE ENTIRE TIME. Seriously? You only have like three tables to take care of and you stand around and talk with a bartender for the entire day? \\n\\nMy friend had to wave him over to get a check, and even THEN we were forced to wait until he picked it up from the table- SINCE HE WAS RIGHT BACK WITH THE BARTENDER!\\n\\nNot one person who works here seems to care about anything but standing around and talking to one another- there were plenty of other workers there, but I never saw one, NOT ONE doing anything. Well, except for the only other waitress there, who was actually doing her job. But she was the only one.\\n\\nI don't ever expect to come back, at least not at the same time since that seems to be the shift where all the lazies are put on."}

We were even more excited about the fact that it delivers. He ordered the chicken and waffles ($9) and I ordered the fried chicken with sides of macaroni and cheese, hush puppies, and corn ($14). The ordered was delivered in 45 minutes. The chicken and waffles were good enough to satisfy the craving. The waffles seemed too similar to an Eggo waffle for me to give much praise too. My order of fried chicken as well as the fried chicken topping the waffle lacked any flavor and was overcooked. The skin and batter was a dark brown color and was slightly bitter. The macaroni and hush puppies were mediocre and the corn was straight out of a can. All in all, not terrible, but for the price, I probably will not eat there again."}

It was not how I normally wear it, but it was cute.  It took a bit of getting used to.  Note that during this process I was never told the price of the extensions.  I figured it might be around $300, but certainly not the total I was presented with at the end - $1300.00!  Um, wow!  I paid because I had an event to attend, and chalked it up to experience.  The next day I was in the Fashion Show Mall with a friend getting sparkle strands threaded through her hair.  The station had the exact same extensions (brand name and length) as Dollheads.  The kiosk woman noticed my extensions and asked where I had gotten them, and for how much.  I was embarrassed, so I didn't say, and instead asked her how much they were here.  She said $300 - ugh, I felt terrible that I had been oversold by so much!  I sent an email/web comment to the Dollheads salon to address the situation, and never received a response.

{"_id": 1, "text": "First of all, I wasn't expecting much considering that we were staying at Hooters.  BUT there is a common \\\"customer service\\\" factor that should exist within every hotel be it a cheap or expensive one.   My friend and I were there for a 3-day music festival, so we were rarely in our hotel room, which gave housekeeping plenty of time every day to come into our rooms to tidy up. This only happened once and on the day before we were checking out.  The bell man who helped us to our room with all of our luggage was extremely smug and you could tell that he hated his life. Sorry dude... get a different job, don't bring me into your dislike for what you do, I didn't force you to work here.  We ordered room service a couple times.  One of the times an extremely snotty girl named Marian was more than awful to my friend and I, not only did she get the order wrong, but when we called to get it fixed she argued with us and told us that they took pictures of every order leaving the kitchen... if that was the case she would be able to see that it was wrong, but proceeded to argue before finally sending someone up with the 2 items that we needed to make it right.  Another time we were walking up to the host stand to get a menu to take to our room and the girls at the front kept saying how drunk they were and were giggling too much to pay attention to us standing in front of them.  \\n\\nOn the plus side, the A/C works really well, the blackout curtains are a gem, and the water pressure in the shower was really on point.   We did have an older bell man that helped us take our luggage TO our car when we were leaving and that man was super helpful and friendly.  He even helped us with directions on how to get out of Vegas from where we were. \\n\\nI'm not sure if I would ever stay there or really recommend  this hotel to any of my friends.

There are better things to spend ones money on.  But the fact remains that I was hot and needed something cold while waiting in the area for an appointment one hour away.  So I went in and saw they had a strawberry yogurt and NY Cheese Cake yogurt next to each other.  I got a small bit of both swirled in the smallest bowl I could find.  I topped it with a few strawberries and some Golden Graham cereal.  $2 and change later I was sitting down relaxing and eating my fro-yo.  It was OK but not mind blowing.  The first bit of yogurt that came out of the machine was watery and a bit off putting.  The NY Cheese Cake tasted more like coconut than cheese cake.  Both yogurts had icy chunks that I did not much like biting into.  It reminded me of my grandma's homemade ice cream but it was rather unlike the creamy frozen yogurt that I know I've had elsewhere.

{"_id": 0, "text": "Upgrade to one star based on the fact that we did eventually get resolution to our issue.  And now the details...\\nWe made the mistake of not looking up this store on Yelp when we happened by it after going elsewhere in the same shopping center (The Dump).  We found a kitchen table that fit the bill for the size we had in mind.  We had a very friendly salesman and worked out a price that we could stomach and purchased the set.  Next, how to get this set into our kitchen.  We had two options: 1. have it delivered for a fee or 2. pick it up.  Well, I had a vehicle large enough to accommodate the set, so I wanted to do that.  What's that you say?  I have to go way out to the Avenues to pick it up?  Hogwash!  We opted to pay delivery and not have to don our Kevlar vests to make the pickup.  (OK, I favor the East Valley- sue me).  \\nThat is where things went sideways.  \\nThe \\\"warehouse\\\" folks did not call the day before our scheduled delivery, which concerned me as that was the one thing I was promised as the time was a range.  No call within a couple hours of delivery so I called the store, who got me the warehouse number.  When I called, I was told that the set was on the truck and on the way.  I confirmed the address and they had the wrong name AND address.  They were trying to deliver my set to some guy out in the WV.  They rerouted the truck and they eventually arrived after 5:00PM when we had a morning delivery scheduled.  \\nUpon assembly, they quickly left and we took some time to inspect the merchandise.  There were two issues: 1. one chair wobbled due to a leg being about 1/2\\\" shorter than the rest.  The second issue was in relation to a bench that came with the set.  It had a upholstered seat and it appeared a box had been placed on it, leaving a depression that was pretty severe.  We gave it 24 hours to even out, but it didn't.  We then called the warehouse and were asked by a skeptical sounding lady to text her pictures of the bench so she can make sure ACME (the manufacturer) would do a replacement.  Instead, we stopped by the store to let them know the issues we had with the delivery.  The customer service manager was very friendly and helpful.  He ordered new legs for the chair and another bench.  The legs came into the store, and I picked those up but there would be a wait for the bench.  Again, they did not call to confirm the delivery window when the promised date arrived.  When I called the warehouse to confirm again, I was told that they ALWAYS call.  I begged to differ but again, she was skeptical.  By the time we got the replacement bench delivered, nearly a month had passed since the original purchase.  Notably, the new bench cushions looked a little different than the other (it was much less loosely covered).\\n\\nOverall, the store experience was decent (at least I was told what they thought that I wanted to hear), the product quality was mediocre but the delivery process and warehouse employee made me want to...write a review on Yelp."}

However, the lunch breaks offered very little for the people with any dietary restrictions.  Even my local sandwich shop in Austin TX can make me a sandwich with gluten free bread.....not so much in Vegas.  I ate salads for lunch and eggs/bacon for supper mostly as I was too tired to find a good restaurant with a chef that can do gluten free/dairy free.  Thought the gambling area smelled like smoke, so I didn't do any gambling there.  Since my only other experiences in Vegas are either at the Bellagio or Mandalay Bay, the Mirage is average at best IMHO.\\n\\nUpdate later that same year:  Girls weekend in Vegas for 4 ppl.  Reservations made all together on one credit card and one name so they are linked together.  Requested adjoining/connecting rooms as this was a girls weekend.  When we arrived the reservations were NOT linked.  They did not have us in adjoining or connecting rooms.  They did NOT alter that fact, nor did they seem to care that this was inconvenient or a problem.  They did not address it or offer any compensation for this HUGE inconvenience.  It really affected the trip that if two of us went up and were not the two sharing the same room, then we either had to be apart or cart items between the rooms...same goes for sharing accessories, having morning coffee, etc.  It was just a drag.  The Mirage was seemingly unaware of how girls weekends operate.  Their attitude was uncaring and I will NEVER go back.  Why make a reservation for two rooms in advance if the reservation itself is not honored?  Why pay a reservation hold fee if it isn't holding what you want?  Why go out of town for a girls weekend, if you can't spend the weekend with the girls?  We did have fun, but the inconvenience was a bit dampening.  If you expect good customer service go to the Bellagio, if you want clean rooms and no service, then stay here."}

{"_id": 4, "text": "We returned to B&B so I could sample the drive thru.  I am glad I did, as this burger was so good it warrants an extra star for B&B.  The drive thru is a double patty, double American cheese burger.  It has mayo, ketchup, mustard, pickles, leaf lettuce and tomato.  It's served on a sesame seed bun, then wrapped in butcher paper.  I was blown away by how good this burger is.  The thin patties are my preference.  I guess they remind me of all the diners and onion burger joints in Oklahoma from my childhood.  The thin patties at B&B were done to perfection.  Literally, I have no idea how they cooked these this well.  The thing about thin patties is you don't want to cook them too much that aren't juicy, but you need to cook them long enough that they get the delicious crispy ends.  Well, B&B managed to leave this burger pink in the middle, thus ensuring maximum juiciness, while getting the crispy edges that make thin patties so good.  Very impressive.  \\n\\nWrapping the whole thing in butcher paper allows the cheese to properly melt, and sort of crams all the flavors together.  I have found my burger at B&B for future visits.  The fact that this thing is only $9 is amazing, especially when you consider the price of comparably sized burgers at enormous fast food chains is only about $3 less.  Get to B&B and try this burger, unless you hate things that are delicious."}

Well needless to say the music was extremely loud as we were ordering and I could barely hear the cashier, therefore because of that our option was to sit outside in order to have a conversation without going deaf.

{"_id": 0, "text": "This updated review is a direct reflection of the massage portion of my recent visit to Just For You.  My best friend was in town so we decided to treat ourselves to the Half Day Package. I provided this feedback and after a week, I have heard nothing.  I have amended some content due to character limits here: \\n\\n     I was so pleased with Heather's technique (during the facial portion of the appointment) and the session was a raging success from my perspective.  I was extremely relaxed when my facial was over and I was invited into the massage room by Allison.  \\n\\n     As a Licensed Massage Therapist myself, I do have some expectations for a massage session and understand every therapist is different and no two sessions are the same. Unbeknownst to me, my best friend had already told Allison that I am a Licensed Massage Therapist; I did not share with Allison that I am a Licensed Massage Therapist myself and I did not know that she had already been told.  I did not want her to feel like I would be \\\"testing\\\" her in any way. With that in mind, I climbed onto the quite high massage table and settled in for what I was hoping would be a therapeutic session as \\\"Allison specializes in stress reduction, sports massage, and relaxation massage.\\\"  I work two jobs and had not received bodywork in almost a year.  \\n\\n     I can best summarize the session by sharing that Heather had a more therapeutic and relaxing touch than Allison did.  Allison talked for the first 10 minutes of what turned out to be a 45 minute (not an hour) session.  She seemed more interested in my main job title than in seeking feedback about her pressure.  Not wanting to jump the gun and to ensure I provided her ample time to check in regarding the pressure, I waited.  Allison proceeded to tell me by back was \\\"loosening up nicely\\\" which was not an accurate statement in the least.  Allison kept moving over an area that was tense due to a poor sleeping position days earlier, something had I mentioned mid-session, and instead of applying direct pressure to ease that tension, she caused soreness and inflammation with the repeated palpation of the site.  After having me move into a supine position, Allison proceeded to begin an abdominal massage that felt very awkward and insecure.  To successfully conduct an abdominal massage, a towel or cloth heavier than the sheet already on the body should be used over the chest so when the sheet is pulled toward the feet to expose the abdomen, the client does not feel exposed.  Ideally, a conversation would have been had with the client regarding the area as it is not typically an area of the body where most people are comfortable receiving bodywork.  I am trained and experienced in abdominal massage and I found myself questioning what was happening before I realized that abdominal work was next.  Courtney shared with me that she, too, had felt awkward during this part of the session as she felt like she was just having her stomach rubbed and didn't really understand the purpose of the technique.  She also shared that she had asked Allison for more pressure during her session and Allison complied, providing more pressure for about a minute and then resuming her previous technique.    \\n\\n     To make matters more awkward, when we were at the front desk waiting to pay for our services, Allison stood there waiting for payment.  Heather and the other staff member at the desk were on the phone and Courtney and I were happy to wait for them to finish.  Allison even made mention that she didn't know how to finalize the payment portion of the visit but then attempted anyway, losing patience with the two servicing the clients on the phone.  When she was able, Heather apologized for the wait and we honestly had no issue waiting our turn.  When Allison decided to conduct the payment collection herself, I explained to her that we had had a package session that day.  She then gave us the total of $139 when the package price was $135.  I corrected her, even showing her the package I had already mentioned in the brochure, and she accepted our payments for $135.  It was only when it came time for us to add our tips and sign our receipts that Allison seemed to have an interest in our sessions and how we were feeling.  At that point, I just wanted to leave.  I was so utterly disappointed and honestly felt like I had wasted the money that paid for the massage portion of the package as there was nothing relaxing or therapeutic about what transpired during that session.  As we were leaving, Allison reminded us to \\\"drink lots of water\\\" and I thought to myself, \\\"For what?\\\"  She didn't do anything that promoted a need for water in addition to what I already consume. \\n\\n     I wanted to bring my experience to your attention as I truly feel that, although her technique may be appreciated by some, it has confirmed that I will not be booking another massage session at Just For You."}

Management thought it was appropriate to enter our room without permission in order to place this letter inside instead of under the door. To me this is unacceptable. We complained and were told that they delivered the same letter in this fashion to all hotel guests. That is not a valid reason and in fact makes everything worse, because now I know that you don't respect the privacy of any guest not just myself. If you don't mind things like this, go ahead and stay here."}

{"_id": 0, "text": "We enjoyed living here for 3 years; however, when we bought a house we put in our 60 day notice. We kept the apartment immaculate and were never late on payments. They wanted to do the walk through without us; however, I insisted that my father-in-law be present since it was after our move out date and I didn't trust them to give an accurate move out quote. I wanted to be proactive and called a couple days after the walk through to find out if we would be getting our deposit back or if there were any charges. They told me they couldn't help me and told me someone else dealt with move outs and would call me as soon as they returned to the office. Of course, they never called. I called again and got the same response. Assuming this was the second time I went out of my way to find out about the deposit, I assumed they would have this person call me back. Nope! I called a THIRD time, still no one could help me except this ONE person who clearly doesn't do her job. I finally had my father-in-law go to the office because at this point it was a month after our move out date. He spoke with the manager Kelly, who gave him a long story about how they take photos and it goes to the corporate office and someone would get back to us soon. Being proactive proved to not work with this company. Tonight, we received a letter titled \\\"Urgent attention requested by Christine Hambric, the assistant manger who was supposed to return four of my requests.\\\" It states that the \\\"balance due for the apartment has been held from collections for WELL OVER 30 days. If no contact is made, the balance will be referred to collections.\\\" My husband and I are furious. Not only did we contact them 4 times in the last month and a half, but they have never returns my calls and this is the first time we have heard from them. There is not even an explanation of the fees. The letter just states that it will go to collections if it is not paid in a week. The office will be hearing from me bright and early tomorrow. If they don't resolve this, I will contact those at the corporate office. This is no way to treat people that were always on time with payments, clean, and respectful residents. I am not a person that writes poor reviews and find that we are very easy going people. However, I cannot believe that a company could treat good residents like this. Do yourself a favor and don't live here. I'm extremely disappointed."}

My boyfriend has always been wary of calamari because of its texture, but Sedona's calamari has transformed him into a believer!  The mussels and ahi tuna lettuce wraps are delicious as well.\\n\\nI ordered the ribeye steak with shrimp and my boyfriend ordered the filet mignon with scallops.  The ribeye steak was incredibly flavorful and juicy.  Along with the steak, there were 5 huge shrimps which were very succulent.  My boyfriend's filet mignon was cooked very well, and the scallops were orgasmic and cooked to perfection.  I've never seen scallops so big before!\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the white chocolate and blueberry (?) bread pudding and the creme brulee.  Both were deliciously amazing!

No real complaints, but in my opinion, it should be either table-service or a fast-food place, not this weird hybrid of the two.

{"_id": 2, "text": "Girls' Dinner Club visited for Restaurant Week. This review is strictly based on the $30 restaurant week menu/$15 wine pairing. My opinion on Restaurant Week is that the menus should highlight the skill and direction of the restaurant, which unfortunately I do not think Bistro 19 was effective in doing. Regular menu prices are $19-30 for entrees, $8-15 wines by the glass. They also regularly do special dinners, one of which coming up is a local corn dinner (all dishes made with corn!). \\n\\nService was great - timely, and unobtrusive. Appetizers were the highlight of the meal. I had a watermelon crab gazpacho, that started a little sweet, and finished with a hint of spice. Fresh lump crab and a beautiful deep red color. This is one I will try to reproduce. Entrees were a little blase. Options were a Parm/Panko crusted chicken with whipped potatoes and zucchini salad; or salmon with a lime-caramel glaze, green beans, and a chilled asian noodle salad. The chicken dish was all one color, which to me was generally unappealing - but the crowd seemed to approve. Salmon was dry (although I will admit, I am a salmon elitist and since having it sous vide, salmon will never be the same) and the glaze was non-apparent. The green beans were the best part of the plate. There was a third dish offered; a pasta with alfredo, which no one ordered so I can't comment, but pasta with alfredo is a little 1998.  \\n\\nAt the end of the day, the food was just nothing special. It has good intention, but execution missed the mark. \\n\\nMy inner environmentalist also has a big concern with the sustainability factor here. Bay of Fundy salmon was a highlight on the restaurant week menu. The chef's 'signature' dish is Chilean Sea Bass. Unless the restaurant could ensure they were purchasing MSC-certified fish, I would hesitate to order any seafood here because I do not agree with the philosophy of serving endangered fishes. \\n\\nI like the ambiance; its a cool interior with a nice little bar area - modern, but warm at the same time.

Then some other women who worked there were watching me like a hawk as if I had sticky fingers and was pilfering everything that I touched. So I was either totally invisible to the staff or I was a 14 year old with a couple of friends seeing how much I could throw in my bag and up my sleeves.\\n\\nBasically they sell H&M or Forever 21 accessories for higher prices. I'm not confident that paying more for their products would make my skin green less quickly. It's still a cheaply produced product. You could find some good stuff on clearance or as-is here, but I wouldn't ever buy anything full price here because it's definitely not quality goods."}

Don't they have better things to do?\\\".....now, she said this with contempt in her voice.  Clearly she wanted to go home right at closing, but with a store full of customers and a long line of PAYING customers, it was cutting into her free time.\\n\\nThat comment made me sick......in today's economy, she should be happy that they had a long line of people at the cash register!

Tasted like they put tons of salt on it. I was hoping that the additional green peppers, onioins, and mushroom would give it some flavor but I would not  have noticed they were there if I did not order it. The crust was all right but how do you screw up a thin-crust? Let's not hold them to that though...\\n\\nThe cheesy bread was cheesy, crappy, and salty all rolled into one. \\n\\nThe chicken wings were not as cooked as I would have liked which made it even more gross.  There was a lot of skin on them. GROSS GROSS GROSS!!!  I am not sure what kind of sauce they put on it but it looked like watered down ketchup and it just looked plain nasty. It did not look appetizing at all! On a normal day I can throw down a double order of wings with no problem but with this I only ate 2 pieces and said to myself \\\"what a waste of money.\\\" \\n\\nThe chocolate crunchy thing tasted okay but it was very sweet. I might be diabetic now because of it. \\n\\nNext time it's late and no one is open for delivery then I will either starve or get my lazy as up and drive somewhere that is open.

By this time, we had just given up on the room and was grateful to check out and move on. \\n\\nBartender service was a little unfriendly.

I felt super uncomfortable at the bar and instantly regretted even going there!\\n\\nAlso got a coupon booklet. Word of advice: get your jello shots from Fat Tuesdays. They're $1 and not... more than whatever they have the coupon for. Also, coupon for well drinks isn't really worth it. In fact, we just threw away our coupon book after thinking it over. There are lots of better deals out there that you can take advantage of. \\n\\nOverall? You get what you paid for.

Food is really heavy, rich, and greasy-almost like fast food type and for what you get, it's pretty expensive.

It comes out stacked beautifully with dipping sauces of ranch and such, and was actually pretty good-probably the best part of the entire meal. For my main entree I ordered the truffle mac and cheese ($14). The dish was decent, but nothing too memorable, just a bunch of cheese mixed into some pasta, which I couldn't even finish because it was just too rich after a couple of bites. High heel pump sandwich ($16) is HUGE, but it's also a got so much going on in it it that it becomes a big sloppy mess to eat. My friend ordered the ABC burger which she said was good, but nothing great that would make her come back for it again, especially for $16.50. Maybe this place is better left for desserts.

Im on a burrito a day. Im pretty much the mexican Jared. (Yared?)...Anyway I ordered a Pastor burrito here and the woman was very excited to tell me that this was indeed special pastor, and that if I was actually ordering it on purpose, and not just another gringo who got lost outside of Wal Mart, then I would be very impressed. I explained I am a very appreciative eater and had an eye for Pastor since I was from California...They asked and when I did not say LA they were dissapointed, which saddened me and lowered my expectations a bit.  \\nThe woman was very friendly, but it was so quiet in there, and her being the talkative type, I decided to wait in my car. I never like to chill staring at the spanish programming, while someone slaves away on my 6 dollar purchase. Ultimately, I think this helped. \\nThe Pastor was indeed amazing. Its chopped small, roasted and then grilled for a crispy texture. The seasoning is top notch, and not coincidentally I assume, it tasted exactly like the only other Pastor I have seen cooked like this. A place in Santa Cruz called Tacos Morenos, whose own legend can be heard on the wind of a warm October night. \\nUnlike morenos, who uses pintos and a thin layer of melted cheese on the burrito, this one contained rice and refried beans. Pretty bland. What saved the day was the salsa. its got a major kick, but more to your brow than your tongue. So consumption can continue :) \\n\\nBottom line: They were very friendly and I say the Pastor is a MUST try. If you are simple, get the soft tacos, dont forget the salsa and if you like, remember to let em know."}

It has a family run feel, and has been there since 1948.  There are plenty of selection of both pizzas and pastas.  We sampled both pizzas and pastas, and didn't feel like either were exceptional in any way.  The pizza crust tasted store bought, and the pasta was bland and creamy.  It wasn't what I was hoping for, but maybe that is because everyone has told me that the best pizza in Montreal is found here, and I guess I was a lot disappointed.

Something you would expect to see in a 2nd grader's brown bag lunch.  Regular wheat bread, oscar meyer brand turkey, one piece of lettuce, soggy tomato, mayo, and mustard.

Now, I know I'm in North Carolina where pulled pork is king, but I can't pass up brisket. I ordered a 1 meat plate with beef brisket. The plate comes with 2 sides and I chose the baked potato casserole and the fried onion tanglers.  Boy, did I choose right!  You get a hefty portion of meat with a soft roll with pickles and onions. You can also choose from a variety of sauces at the sauce bar.  My husband also got the brisket but got the jalapeno beans and fried okra.  He said he really liked his plate too.  The brisket was tender with a nice smokey flavor. I chose the original bbq sauce and it was the perfect accompaniment.  And to top it all off, everyone gets free soft-serve vanilla ice cream!

When I was a child I had my favorite used needle.  My homeless friend, Sir Albert Bottomtop used to sit with me for hours on a park bench telling me fantastic stories. He told me about the time he stabbed Peter O'toole in the leg after a drinking binge.  How he once walked in on Helen Mirren, a donkey and 20 ping pong balls.  How once he tackled Winston Churchill to the ground and pink bellied him until finally Chamberlin pulled him off and they all laughed. I cried when he told me about mentioning in passing how hot Wallis Simpson was.  Great stories.  \\n\\nOne day I rode my tricycle to our bench and saw him...he was a beautiful shade of blue. He was clutching a needle. I took it.  I had that needle until I was arrested in Finland for kicking Paavo Lipponen in between the legs and screaming \\\"this is for cooperating with the Stasi.\\\" I smiled before those rotten fish eaters tackled me and my beloved needle fell smashing against the ground. My tears flooded the modern, sleek and tiny toilet in my cell.

If a duck just fell out of your ceiling with 100 dollar bill...LOCATION SPECIFIC...were the secret words of the day. Congratulations.\\n\\nI want to start with the best thing on the menu...the Carne Asada Chimmichanga.  The Chimmichanga is always good...but one tip...ask for it to be extra crispy.  The shell goes from Conan O'Brien with a slight tan color to Cindy Crawford on a bikini photo shoot color...golden brown but not over done.  Second, never get the steak. I will always say this...Roberto's steak sucks. Get the chicken...or...the best one...the carne asada.  Pork. Crispy shell. Did I say pork? Well, read it again...even the word is perfect...think about how you can use it in a sentence. \\\"I ate great pork this weekend.\\\" OR \\\"I gave Emma Stone the pork this weekend.\\\" Both are beautiful. Both make me want to watch the video of that action with my pants down. \\n\\nTacos...are great. The Burritos are good if you observe the meat rule, and the shrimp is surprisingly good. The refried beans are good, and the rice sucks. The super nachos (carne asada) are a hangover godsend. The chule relleno are hit and miss. The taco rolls WITH guacamole are amazing. The red sauce is good, but not the best.\\n\\nRoberto's is like having sex with a 400lb chick with no teeth...sometimes you get lucky and it is great. Sometimes 30 seconds in you wish you were anywhere else.  Drunk is ALWAYS better.\\n\\nYou dream of Rex. Rex dreams of someone else. You dream of Rex more."}

When it arrived, the both said it was a little undercooked. When we cracked a rigaton in half there was the white circle inside. From what I've always been taught and the internet has confirmed that means it's ALMOST done, but not quite. 1 more minute!

Everyone happy.\\n\\nWhen the waiter returned he proclaims, \\\"The chef wanted you to know that if you ever go to Italy ask for your pasta overcooked.\\\"\\n\\nI thought it was really uncalled for and soured the rest of the evening. \\n\\nAlso someone ordered the asparagus risotto.

{"_id": 1, "text": "Got a tattoo here a few months ago by Mario. I'm satisfied with the results of my tattoo, but the overall experience was a little meh. Mostly because I came in with a friend and they treated her quite differently than they treated me. I have red and black hair, and multiple tattoos. I had an idea in my head, and didn't bring a photo with me. My friend is brunette and only has one other tattoo. She brought in a photo of exactly what she wanted. Mario gave her a really hard time about doing it exactly how it is in the photo. I understand as an artist you want to be more original, but if somebody is going to pay you, especially for a simple 20 minute tattoo, then I think you should just do it. My tattoo was drawn up quick and done even quicker, because it was just a simple word in old school font. Hers took probably 3 times the time it should have, and she was so upset with how it was turning out that she wouldn't let him finish and left in tears. Not only was it unfinished, and not at all how she wanted it, but she had to pay to have another artist fix it, and it took FOREVER to heal because he basically jabbed the needle so hard into her ankle that it ended up getting infected. You may prefer to do more original work, but YOU aren't the one with this on your body forever. If you don't like a tattoo, and don't want to do it how the person wants it... then say no, and send them to another artist. It's as simple as that."}

{"_id": 4, "text": "One of my favorite bars ever! I love the constantly changing menu (but that long-time customers can still get their favorite \\\"classics\\\"), the quality of the drinks, the laid-back vibe (unless it's 12-2 on a saturday, then it can be super-crowded).  \\n\\nThings you might not know:\\n1.  VEGANS- beware! Some of the drinks contain eggwhites, honey, dairy, or Campari and are not necessarily listed on the menu.  When in doubt, ask the bartender.  They're usually cool about making you a vegan version.\\n\\n2.  Usually the first Monday of the month is \\\"Mixology Monday,\\\" which is a hot mess of a good time.  A guest mixologist makes 4 special cocktails to highlight the featured booze of the evening (I went for Veev Acai liqueur and .... some other stuff that I drank too much to remember what they were... but every time I've gone it's been excellent.)  \\n\\n3.  On weeknights, it's a great place to go with friends/ a date that you actually want to talk to because it's not too crowded, the music is not loud, and the ambiance is nice.\\n\\n4.  Expect to pay about $10/drink.  They also have a \\\"temperance menu\\\" of non-alcoholic drinks that are done mixology style.  Great for  DD's, preggo's, or Mormons!"}

In my opinion, their menu is over priced, but for the quality I guess you could say it's okay. The fries don't come with much and it's about $4-5. The burgers range from about $8-10, but just for the burger itself. Everything is paid separately. If you get a drink though, you can get $1 off. It's located in a good area so I'm sure it gets a lot of business. The people are friendly. However, they messed up on my order. I ordered three burgers (number two, I forgot what they're called but it has egg and onions), fries with crack and ketchup sauce, and a drink. When I got called by my funny nickname, I only had two burgers. I was confused and ended up having to buy another one and spent a total of almost $40. That amount of money for three burgers, a little bit of fries, and a small drink was kinda pushin' it. Not sure why the order was messed up, but other than that little issue, it's not bad. It wouldn't be something I'd crave though."}

Food quality, service and atmosphere are far superior than a Pizza Hut or typical pizza place and yes you pay more!

{"_id": 0, "text": "I used to go to Ingleside animal hospital for all my pets needs. I had a very sick kitty that they could not figure out what was wrong. The only option was exploratory surgery for an amount that was way out of my budget. I also didn't think my kitty would survive the surgery. They attempted to find every $!00 treatment they could over the course of several years. Never did figure out what ailed him. They got the money in the long run. Once my kitty needed some more antibiotics for an abscess that Dr. Serbin had already seen and prescribed for. The abscess came back. I had recently lost my car and my job and asked if they could just call a script in to a local pharmacy as i didn't have the $ for a cab ride or the visit. It had been 4 months since his last office visit and like i said they had seen this poor kitty dozens of times on deaths door over years. He told me it wasn't ethical to prescribe the meds that i needed to come in. I was irrate. I had just been in there for another cat 2 months prior and had a standing antibiotic script for him so I asked if they could call in the script for the other animal they had just seen. He told me that he wouldnt because he knew I would give it to the other animal.  I ended up having to get my hands on some from someone else. otherwise my poor cat would have went without. I wrote a letter to them of how upset i was and got no reply.\\n\\n A few years later after trying many other vets and the sick kitty had passed away the other kitty I had needed a dental cleaning. I had saved adamantly to acquire the funds to get it done over 2 years. (its very expensive. In light of my experiences there I trusted their competency with doing the dental surgery so I returned back money in hand over $400. My anger from previous grievances were furthest from my mind had just about forgotten and just wanted my cats teeth cleaned. On the day of the appt because of my cats age they did pre blood work for the surgery and it came back he was diabetic. I couldn't believe it i had another cat that was diabetic and this one didn't show any of the signs i was shocked so they ran some more tests and loaded me up with insulin and never cleaned his teeth. My bill was just about all of the $400 i had desperately saved. Every time i gave the cat insulin his sugar would crash. I ended up going to a different vet (BLUE CROSS animal hospital) who eventually did the surgery and said that his mouth was causing his diabetes and he just needed it done. I suspect  Ingleside purposely ran my bill up and didn't treat my animal because of past disputes. I have no proof but I will never pass on a chance to warn other cat owners to avoid them I will never return there and am so much happier with BCAC. I live in tempe now but will gladly drive to BCAC."}

{"_id": 3, "text": "The Monte Carlo is the practical strip-goer's casino. It is probably the best balance of price and comfort available on the strip. It also offers an extremely high convenience factor when compared to other strip casinos. I'll explain.\\n\\n1. There's a CVS right next door. In a town like Vegas, spontaneous supplies such as sunscreen, sunglasses, water, and Plan B may become crucial to a successful trip. When you stay at the Monte Carlo, your 24 hour CVS is just a quick walk away.\\n\\n2. There's a tram to Aria and Bellagio. If walking is starting to get to you, this tram is your answer. It comes often and quickly whisks you a few hotels north so you can save your walking energy for later. This is especially useful if you need to get to the Bellagio quickly to give someone Plan B or money you owe them.\\n\\n3. You aren't going to be killed by mobs when you walk around. The Monte Carlo is one of the smaller casino resorts and, as a result, doesn't draw a million people who just sit around and gawk at the craziness of the building. If you end up here with a woman screaming at you about some unplanned pregnancy, you're not going to draw nearly the number of stares that you would at the Venetian. \\n\\n4. The walk from your room to the outside world is very fast. This can be compared to the MGM Grand, where the walk from your room to the strip will take 2 days each way, which is hard when you're dragging someone somewhere while they are trying to make a scene.\\n\\nOh yeah, internet access is included with your room...but you have to use an ethernet cable because the year is 2003."}

The food I had at this bakery was quite good, but the lady serving ruined my experience. I don't expect mile wide smiles everywhere I go - but at least neutrality is a must. \\n\\nI walked in with a friend. She ordered only tea and got a skeptical \\\"is that all look\\\". I got a tea, sandwich, and eclair. The eclair was heaven on earth. I would recommend their baked goods any day. The sandwich was OK. I asked to get it warmed up and mentioned I didn't like cold meat. When I got it at the table, my meat was cold. I walked up and politely asked to have it reheated.  When I got it, it was burnt to a crisp. On top of that, the lady sarcastically asked me if the sandwich was *still* too cold, that I should bring it back again.  That really irked me. She didn't have to say anything. She could have put it down and walked away. I was saddened by my overall experience. I recommend this place for taste only - or if you avoid getting the female server."}
{"_id": 1, "text": "Okay, so as far as the spread, it's kind of sad.  The layout is confusing as hell, but the most disappointing thing about my visit here was the fact that nothing leaped out at me that was so delicious that I kept eating my hangover away.  I came by here and did the 30 dollar mimosa champagne brunch and I'm sad to say that I literally ate 1 plate of food.  How miserable is that? I also got a mini plate of desserts that I took a half bite out of each of my 4 things and it was really disappointing.  The only thing that saved me was the fact that their asian section had congee (rice porridge) so I was able to keep something down.  Yeah, I was pretty god damned hung over that day.  Me and my friends talked so much shit to each other telling each other and ourselves that we were going to eat a mountain of food and to have at least 3 plates each, if not 5.  What a sad day.  None of us ate much.  30 bucks for a half eaten plate and a half bowl of rice porridge.  But we did clean them out on the mimosas, cause we're boss like that.  (or stupid) \\n\\nThe food itself wasn't really good and it was actually the worst buffet I've been to in Las Vegas.  I think if you're willing to pay 30 buckaroos for a buffet, I strongly urge you to check out a different joint if you can.  There are far better options out there on the strip that might even be cheaper."}

Nevertheless, it was a lot of fun.  Here are my tips from my first year doing this:\\n\\n1. Show up early.  There's lots going on two hours before the race starts, you can stake out a good parking space, and you can take photos.  Then go back to the car and put your crap away.  Easy!\\n2. Speaking of parking, if you have a high clearance vehicle and/or offroad vehicle consider parking in the gravel lot behind Fry's that fronts LV Blvd.  It was difficult getting out after the race and if you park there, and can get out, you can bail pretty easily.  But only offroad/high clearance vehicles!  I saw a few Camrys that got stuck. :(\\n3. Safety first! Especially if you are doing the half or full marathon the next day.  There are tons of kids, dogs (some not so well behaved), strollers, and other weird things.  People are excitable.  Some people forgot they were running with a dog on a leash and clotheslined people.  The streets at Town Square are narrow.  So, if in doubt, slow down and employ defensive running/walking.  I saw some nasty spills that could have been avoided.  You don't want to be injured for the big race the next day for some 5K that isn't even timed.\\n\\nThis isn't a five star event mostly for the traffic direction.  They need to suck it up and hire Metro.  Town Square security did the traffic direction and they sucked at it.  The guys directing traffic for me (near the entrance to Frys) actually got into a fight with each other!

I called at 3:50 asking if there was anyway to bring my daughter. The lady that answered the phone put me for 30 minutes. When she finally picked up the phone I asked her if she knew how long I was on the phone? She said do you want to make an appointment as too ignore my question. I said I have been on hold for 30 minutes she came back at me with full force and said it is a Monday and 2 people called in today so we are doing the best we can. I feel very uneasy about a pediatrician's office putting a parent on hold for 30 minutes because that is the best they can do. So after I got yelled at for it being a Monday I again explained I need to bring in my daughter and again I was put on hold. Then after being on hold for an additional 10 minutes I was told there were no available appointment's left for today. I told the nurse that I had requested my children's medical records 2 months ago and I want to know where they are (due to a very bad experience I had with the doctor a few months before this episode) and again I was put on hold. I finally arrived at the doctor's office with phone in hand and still on hold. By the time I got to the office I had been on hold for 45 minutes because that is the best they can do. I was at the office for another 30 minutes while 3 different employees told me one lie after another on where my kids medical records were. So if you calculate it all up I was dealing with them for one hour and 15 minutes and in all of that time someone could of seen my daughter. I gave this office 2 chances with my kids and that was 2 chances too many.   \\n\\nOne last note...When my son was sick with RSV and I was trying to get ahold of the office I had to leave a message with triage and it took them 3 hours to get back to me. They told me they had lunch that is what took so long. I was already in the ER when they called back and ended up in the ICU of children's hospital that night."}

The next day at brunch the waiter totally forgot about me and I couldn't get a refill and eventually had to ask someone else to bring me my check.

This was about the last time I even remember being satisfied at this restaurant.\\n\\nSeveral groups around us were served several times before our waiter ever returned to go over the menu.  It was about 15 minutes from the time we received our menus to anyone ever returning to our table.\\n\\nWe had informed the person we made the reservation with that we had a show to attend more than 2 hours after our reservation, but just wanted to ensure we had enough time.\\n\\nAfter the atrocious wait time for even a drink order, the waiter finally acknowledged our table and just asked if we were ready to order, failing to cover anything on the menu, give any sort of introduction, or talk about the chefs specials.  If this was standard for the restaurant I could understand, however we heard him give this introduction to every table seated after us that was nearby.\\n\\nI reminded him politely after taking my order that we did have a show to get to, and just making sure we could leave on time.

He brought a special dessert for our friend whose birthday we were celebrating.  It was a nice touch, but just too little too late.

I would definitely head to Old Town Scottsdale or North Scottsdale where I think the sushi is better for the price. Kabuki is pretty expensive, but I would guess it has to be based on it's prime location at Tempe Marketplace. The service is great and the selection of food outside of sushi is large as well.

{"_id": 2, "text": "Ok so i waited a few days after my vacation to review this place so as to let everything settle in. \\nFirst off, I wanted to say that i came here having high hopes as this hotel is a staple on the Vegas strip and it came highly recommended. \\n\\nCHECK IN:\\nOne thing to note for anyone coming here for the first time, if you arrive before 10am they do not let you check in. Other places, such as the Palazzo where I stayed the year prior, let you check in regardless of time and call you or text you when your room is ready. Mirage does not let you do this until after 10am. I did not know this and was literally waved away by the front desk clerk. Neither did she explain this to me.  She didn't seem approachable enough for me to feel comfortable to go back to and ask ANY questions.I had to call the 800 number to ask this. She was pleasant and answered all my questions.\\nThe bell hop at the from of the hotel was unfortunately very rude to me too. I must've forgot to say thank you because he angrily and sarcastically said \\\"you're welcome!\\\" to me. I guess to point out the fact that i forgot to thank him. My bad for not thanking him but i was just waved away from the desk clerk and trying to figure out why. Im sure Im not the ONLY person who didn't thank him. Is he rude to EVERYONE?! I found myself apologizing to HIM! WTH! Keep in mind theses were my VERY first interactions with the staff. And based on their job positions, theses are the very first interactions most people have. I tried hard not to let this ruin my day. I kept on. \\n\\nHOTEL: \\nOne thing you'll notice as soon as you walk in is an odd odor. Im not saying its bad as I'm sure a lot of people must like it. But its not for me, It took about the entire 3 days of my trip for me to get used to it. Its very intoxicating and really hard to take at first. Its like a punch to my face. You'll know what I'm talking about if you go visit other hotels during your stay. Theirs is a bit more subtle. A little smoky too. Other than that though, the premises are kept pretty clean. Crowd is probably a little younger than my liking. With youth usually comes a lot of rowdy behavior and late night hallway shenanigans. I was awoken a few times by this during my stay. Vegas, right?! I just didn't get awoken at other places Ive stayed at on the strip that were higher end. I guess its more normal than I thought. Gym is great (check out my review of the spa/salon)\\nRooms are clean and modern. Housekeepers, sweet as pie. Always kept us fully stocked.\\nMy clock radio in the room never worked. Never called to get this replaced or fixed as to not deal with anymore staff.\\nBeds were a little too soft for my taste. I like soft but these were hard to sleep in. \\n\\nPOOL:\\nPool is huge and fun. Very lush and beautiful waterfalls. I enjoyed my time here. You have to get here early to get seats, they fill up fast. They only have about 1 waitress servicing different sections. Greats are good. Mine looked horrendous but tasted great. CAUTION: tips IS added on. Is this legal? So unless you intend to double tip, don't fork over any extra cash if you don't have to.\\n\\nOVERALL:\\nMy overall stay here was ok. If everything during your stay goes perfectly and you don't have to deal with the staff, then you should have a very pleasant trip. If you should have the unfortunate luck that something goes wrong and you have to ask for help. GOOD LUCK!\\nI more than likely will not be coming back here. Would only recommend this place if you don't care about great customer service and are just looking for a place to stay. I work hard for my money and don't make much. When i finally am able to get away for a few days and decide to stay at your hotel with the many options there are, why would you want to be rude?!\\nI do want to give a shout out to the bell hop on the way out. Wish I knew his name. He was super nice and helpful. Too bad i couldn't have met him on day one."}

How hard is it to just answer the phone?\\n\\nAnyways, my old hairdresser had a baby and is no longer doing hair, so I went to groupon to find a deal (since going to a new place always scares me) and if I liked the place, hopefully make it my new salon. Anyways, the green room was having a groupon, so I bought it and then spent the whole day trying to get someone to answer the phone to book my appointment. I finally got an appointment with Juan, who I was told was really good. \\n\\nI went to my appointment, fairly nervous since I hadn't had anyone different colour my hair in 6 years, and waited to see Juan. He was friendly enough. You could tell he wasn't interested in talking. When he did ask me a question, he didn't even listen to my response. Anyways, I let him know I had the groupon and what I wanted done. I even had a picture of my hair right after I had gotten it done that he could reference. As far as the highlights go, he did an alright job. It was the cut and the treatment of my hair that was horrible and I will never go back because of it. He treated my hair like it he was working on a mannequin. I have a neck and actually can't hold my head up when you're ripping at it as hard as possible. It was absolutely horrible. He first dried my hair (while ripping at it) then started the cut. I have long, blonde hair. I like to keep it that way. So I asked him for the tiniest trim. I said 1/4 of an inch. I guess I was hoping he would treat my hair better, and dry cut the small amount I said, but no. He cut off a good 3 inches. He also cut layers into my hair which I never asked for. And, I have curly hair. He blow dryed it straight and that was that. He didn't run a straightener through it or anything. So I left the salon with an okay colour, shorter hair than I ever wanted, and a massive mane because he couldn't take the 5 extra minutes to straighten it. I suppose maybe that was a good thing. I am not sure my head could take the extra pounding. \\n\\nAll I know is I will be finding a new salon to get my hair done.\\n\\n\\nAnd in reply to Eric's comment, firstly, as a business owner, don't you think the most appropriate response would have been \\\"sorry- we strive for perfection. good luck in your search for a new salon\\\"? Yes, that would have been. Instead you rudely reply with completely false information. No, my hair wasn't fried. And no, I did not give the ok for more than a trim. Also, I did call during business hours and did leave 2 messages. Your system needs fixing if you want more clients. Anyways, your rude response not only makes me never want to go back... but also to never ever refer anyone to you. You have proven not to be customer service orientated business."}

Mushrooms ($12-16) were much the same. \\nNo presentation to the food to speak of at all.  \\nThe worst part about it all was that the steak was so big that it took us a while to work our way through it, and when it got cold, the oil and grease it was cooked with kind of congealed with the fatty-ness of the meat and I just couldn't eat it anymore because it tasted so oily and fatty.  If they are going to give such large portions of such fatty meat, they need to think of a way to keep it warm, or at least not let the fat congeal while you are eating it.  \\nSeemed a bit overpriced for what we got."}

Nothing superiorly amazing that'll make me come back for though. Lobster bisque was okay, a bit towards the saltier side and not as creamy as expected. There was this shrimp dish, forgot the name, but it had Dijon mustard as part of the sauce and it was pretty good. For my entree, I had the double cut lamb chop 18oz.

Goat cheese mashed potato was different, I'd probably get that again if I came back. Asparagus fritti, no big deal. Just deep fried asparagus but the sauce with it is not bad.

{"_id": 1, "text": "I have lived in the area for six months, and have yet to find a hair stylist/salon that I want to stick with. After one mediocre experience from a place I found on my own, I came to Salon Sanctuary after it was recommended to me by an acquaintance. She recommended her stylist, Bethany. Upon calling the salon, I was informed that Bethany was not accepting new clients- no big deal, I was willing to try someone else. I ended up booking an appointment with Karen.\\n\\nI arrived to my appointment a few minutes early, and the receptionist told me she would let Karen know I was there. My appointment was at 10:45am. I sat and read magazines, and watched time tick by....and by.... and by... No one- receptionist included, said a word to me about the wait. It wasn't that I didn't have time to wait, or that I even would have cared to wait, it was that no one bothered to say, \\\"She's running a bit behind, it will be about X amount of minutes,\\\" or anything of the sort. In fact, by 11:20, I decided I'd give her a few minutes and then I'd just walk out the door. Around 11:25, as I was getting ready to leave, I was called back. Turns out, she'd been putting highlights in a client's hair the entire time, and was not yet even done with the client. She did not apologize for my wait. She asked what I wanted done, and I stated that I had an appointment for a cut, highlights and lowlights, and a brow wax, but was not sure at this point what she had time for. She asked what I meant and I asked if my appointment was scheduled for 10:45am, and she said that it was, but quietly added that her last client was an HOUR LATE. I'm sorry, but in my experience working in customer service, if a client is more than a few minutes late, and serving them will significantly cut into another client's appointment, you reschedule with the late person. However, I remained polite and explained what I wanted done. She spent the vast majority of my appointment going back and forth between her other client and myself, and I felt like she was rushing quite a bit. When the receptionist told her that her next client was there, she left and talked to the client, apologizing and explaining that there would be a wait!!! If only she extended the same courtesy to all of her clients...\\n\\nOverall, the cut and the brow wax were just what I wanted, but the color was not quite what I explained, and I looked a lot more \\\"trendy\\\" than I wanted- BUT nothing horrible that I couldn't live with for a few months. It didn't look bad at all, but just not what I typically go for. Pricing was very fair. Had all of the customer service issues not been present, I'd have given my experience 4 stars, and I'd probably have given her another try. However, after the issues I did experience, I know I would not return to Karen and am not sure if I'd even give the salon another shot or not."}

{"_id": 3, "text": "I have came here a few times and I think it's time to have an overall opinion of this place.\\n\\nFood 4 stars\\nThey just made some changes to the menu, which is quite extensive for a BBQ joint.  Their wings are among my favorites (if not THE favorite). They are big and meaty and grilled. And even better, 6 for $5 (or 50 cents each on late night bar menu). Buffalo was good but I like the chipotle apricot best.  The chili is different; it was made with chunk of meats... More sweet than savory but still awesome for a cold night. The bacon devil eggs are easy to be consumed: open mouth, pop one in.  They can fill it up a little more but it is an appetizer. And the newest addition to the app menu is the giant hush puppies.  And they are good... Honey butter makes it even better. \\nThe kitchen that started Macs is behind this joint.  While I was never a big fan of macs, I am pleased by this place.  Their smoked chicken is moist (I had dark meat). Brisket is a thick slice type.  My only suggestion is for the sauce to be toned down a little since they do have sauces to be used at table.  Some side items are lacking in the wow factor, but then I am a tough judge on Mac and cheese (and onion rings were a little bland too). I do LOVE the corn, which tastes even better the next day.  \\n\\nService 3 stars\\nWhile I never had bad services here, I find the waitresses to be a little lacking in enthusiasm. On my first visit I was asking for input on what to order, which I think for a newer joint like this, a convincing (and honest) suggestion from the wait staff can go a long way.

The times that I have seen a show, I couldn't have been more pleased. The ticket prices are reasonable, there is plenty of room to stand or even sit and see the show, the sound is top-notch, and as an added bonus there is a large bar in the stage area. When it is not extremely crowded (more on that later), the lounge area is an excellent choice to have a few drinks, smoke on their patio, and I have heard the food is pretty good, too. I have no complaints about it when it is a slower weekday night. \\nCrescent has been extremely successful and I am very happy to see it do so well. However, on nights of popular shows, or on Saturday nights when they do Kismet, the place is packed. Like WAY too packed. Takes ages to get a drink, and once you do have it, you have to drink it while being pushed and shoved by everyone around you. My biggest complaint though, is the bathroom situation. In the lounge area, there is one toilet. For everyone. This leads to a very long line of people that have been drinking and really need to pee. Also, you're talking about drunk people here, so people have no respect and are constantly cutting in the line or using the private locking bathroom for \\\"recreational\\\" activities. The last time that I was there, it was a Saturday night and I was standing in line for the bathroom. I had been waiting for awhile, when 4 or 5 people rushed into the bathroom. They were in there for-EVER and when they finally opened the door, an enormous amount of pot smoke was rolling out into the main area. Ummmm...believe it or not, it's not funny to hotbox a public bathroom and some people don't actually want a contact high, jackasses.  It was absolutely disgusting having to use that bathroom afterwards. Not to mention, the bathroom there is almost always very dirty, toilet paper everywhere, and everything is always wet. It's gross. I know that Crescent can't control what its customers do, but I hope that they are making plans to add another bathroom or porta-potties or have a way for everyone to use the restrooms in the stage area, or SOMETHING because it really is my only complaint about Crescent Ballroom."}

We booked a Madison Avenue room with 2 queen beds. About 2 weeks prior to my trip I was offered to upgrade to a \\\"premium view room\\\" for another $8 a night, so I figured what the heck. I am so glad I did. The room was big and spacious seeing how we had a corner room with views on 2 sides. \\n\\nNo problems at all checking in, it was fast and easy. The beds were so comfortable my husband and I actually slept all night each night we were there. The room was quiet, I could only hear other showers in the mornings but that wasn't until about 10am or so. The shower/tub combo was great with a deep tub that was great to soak in after those long walks. \\n\\nMy only complaint would be the door going in and out of the room. There is a door thingy (yes, the technical term for it :) at the top of the door that slowed the door down so much (so it doesn't slam) that you have to stand there and wait for it or try to pull it closed, but then it doesn't close right as the top of the door hits the frame. So, every time you open the door you have to wait to make sure it closes before you go walking off. \\n\\nBut, really....that's such a minor little thing! I really loved staying here and with my family, New York New York made us all feel so comfortable giving we had to bring kids to LV. I will definitely be coming back as we visit LV 3-4 times a year and I would absolutely recommend this hotel/casino to anyone"}

Server said he'd take care of it, which he did 15-20 minutes later. Apps weren't bad. Meatballs in a way hot sauce and something that looked worse than it tasted. Entrees were at best terrible. My chicken parm was flattened out to where it took up most of the plate. It was burned on the bottom, with very little cheese or sauce on it. My side of spaghetti was cold. Not just not hot or warm, cold. My wife ordered some shrimp pasta dish, not Alfredo. She told me shrimp was tough and had me try it. It was like eating wet cardboard. She didn't eat anymore of the shrimp but said the pasta thing tasted ok. She flagged down a manager and told her about the shrimp, and told her to go in the kitchen and try it. The manager said, No, I believe you and took it off the check. Our server came and just kept saying, Wow, I'm sorry, Wow, Hmmm, Sorry bout that, Wow, Hmmm, Wow, Sorry, Sorry Guys..Hmmmm. Anyway, I agree this place has seen better days and just needs to fade away. There was a total of 6 tables with other diners. Good concept but failing.

Now mind you, I've never been a huge steak person mainly because most restaurants mess it up by over cooking or leaving a big hunk of oily fat staring at you.

So we set the plates back.\\n\\nTwo new plates arrived with the same exact cuts.  Now I was mad.  We weren't being difficult, but I'm certainly not going to pay $25 for a piece of stew meat.

I lived here 2 years and I am finally moving.\\n\\nPROs:\\n\\n-Good location: light rails, bus, Tempe Marketplace, ASU, Four Peaks Brewery, Park across the street with a \\\"dog park\\\" if you can call it that. (basically a prison yard with a tree in it.)\\n\\n-Cheaper place to live in the area. (you get what you pay for!!!....if not less!)\\n\\n^LITERALLY ALL I COULD COME UP WITH.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n-My girlfriend had two bikes stolen here, first bike was stolen and never recovered. Second bike's lock was cut and the whole bike was taken by the maintenance man because he thought it was abandoned when it was parked right in front of our apartment! We were told to pick it up the following business day as the weekend was coming up and when we did they said it had already been thrown in the dumpster and was never recovered. \\n\\n-The apartments are extremely small and looks nothing like the model. \\n\\n-The Jacuzzi is either cold or extremely hot and the bubbles don't work. The pools are always filthy, and the regular pool is UNrefreshing in the summer, its very warm like you are sitting in bathtub that was filled up hours ago.\\n\\n-They shut off the water unexpectedly and don't turn it back on when they said it should be on by. Sewage has backed up into our sink and tub on two occasions.\\n\\n-The gates are always open and never shut, which could be on the \\\"PROs\\\" list, since I only have a motorcycle and when the gates ARE shut I cant get out unless a car drives out first.\\n\\n-Management is extremely rude and unhelpful, there has been 3 different sets of staff since I've lived here. The maintenance people have never been rude to me however.\\n\\n-They give you a 48 hour notice of entry over a month before you leave to assess your apartment, ONE MONTH BEFORE! The letter encourages the residents to be present and when I asked to have the walk be pushed back just a few days so I could be home when they walk I was told abruptly \\\"NO.\\\" The manager Brittany wouldn't even come out and talk to me she sat in her office and kept relaying everything she had to say to her secretary who was also very rude to me. They wanted to know what I was hiding or why I asked for a few extra days.\\n\\n-I put my notice in to move and they basically interrogated me as to why I was leaving, where I was moving, they wanted my new address even though I didn't have one. I was even told to try to convince my girlfriend to stay.. Uh hello?! We decided to move what don't you get?!\\n\\n-Dog poo everywhere\\n\\n-Several notices to clean up my porch because of things like \\\"litter\\\" after a storm blew a grocery store ad in front of my door.\\n\\n-Paper-thin walls (you can hear stomping, people turning on their showers and sinks, flushing the toilets, baby's crying, dogs barking, floor boards creaking, our window was literally up against someone else's door.)\\n\\n-Things in the apartment constantly breaking or needing repair.\\n\\n-Shady people lurking around all hours of the day/night.\\n\\n-Few shootings across the street at another property and a lady intentionally sped down and alley into another complex's place of living, killing herself.\\n\\nOVERALL:\\n\\nMy favorite part about living here was the location. I left 1 star and that is strictly due to location. I would NOT have given a 0 star if possible I still would have left just 1 star, as I said..strictly due to location."}

The M Resort has an awesome deal for locals in the summer.  $10 for locals, but women can put their name on a list, and it is free entry for the rest of the summer.  Sorry guys, you still need to pay every time.  However, the last time I came, a friend had rented a daybed, and it was free but there was a minimum of $200 in food and drinks.  Well, a huge group of friends came out and did not have to pay entry because we all said we were there for the daybed under our friend's name.  And between the 20 of us, we definitely spent way more than the minimum requirement.  Best of all, the food and drinks were delish! The pitchers of margaritas and mojitos were pretty potent.  They did not skimp on the alcohol at all.  \\n\\nI also love that it is so kid friendly.  There are these huge entrance sections with only 10 inches of water and is the perfect place for the little ones to just wade in and splash.  The crowd is also a lot more laid back and chill than the strip resort pools. There are also a ton of families.  But, my favorite perk is the fact that it is not a long hike to get to the pool from the parking structure.  \\n\\nThe servers are super friendly and we rarely waited to get anyone's attention.

{"_id": 2, "text": "I like a lot of things about Coffee Bean better than Starbucks - their Ice Blended drinks (way better than Frappucinos), their espresso (a lot richer than Starbucks'), and their powder-based (not syrup) formula for flavored drinks. The employees at this location were really friendly, and the fruit-tea blended I got was really good, although it was a little pricey for a regular size (~$5). However, I'm going to have to dock this location two stars for not having their own wireless network and for having very few plugs for laptops. These days, it's pretty much a given that you should be able to go to a coffee shop, get a beverage, and then sit at a table and surf the net. When I first sat down, I noticed that there were no available plugs - the only outlet was far from my seat and was being monopolized by some 10-year-old kid listening to music on headphones and pounding on his computer keys while his parents sat and conversed at a different table. I guess I'll save my commentaries about modern parenting techniques until another time...\\n\\nAnyway, after trying to connect and not seeing a Coffee Bean network, I asked the guy behind the counter if they had wireless. He said no, gave some excuse about how they're still trying to set it up (even though they've been open for some time now), and said I could try to get onto Paradise Bakery's network. That's eventually what I did, but the signal was weak since I was in Coffee Bean and not Paradise (no pun intended!). I didn't want to go buy something else there just to have better signal so I stayed put, but I was very disappointed that I had chosen to go there when I had a few hours to kill precisely to relax and go online and that they didn't provide that basic service."}

{"_id": 4, "text": "If all you want to read is this first sentence, then here's all you really need to know: try their weekend brunch and order the Tofu Scramble. \\n\\nTofu is one of those ingredients that half the world lives in fear of. Another small percentage of the population will brag about the tofu salad they had at lunch, though we all know they had to choke it down. There are then people who have experienced tofu done right and thus genuinely love the stuff. Trust that after trying the Tofu Scramble at Mickey's, you will fit into the latter group of the tofu world. \\n\\nWhat makes this tofu so wonderful is that it's marinated in peanut butter. It's special. A common complaint with this often dismissed soy product is its tendency to taste bland if not prepared correctly. When it's cooked up at Mickey's with just the right amount of rich peanut butter, this worry is null and void. Add to this flavor packed mixture some saut\\u00e9ed spinach, sweet red pepper, and red onion and it's no wonder this dish is known for winning over anti-tofu folks. The fresh produce cuts the intensity of the peanut buttered tofu and offers great contrast in terms of color and texture as well. \\n\\nThough it's only served Saturday and Sunday, the Tofu Scramble is so wonderful you'll be craving it all week long."}

{"_id": 2, "text": "Eh, this market was OK, but it didn't do it for me.\\n\\nA farmer's market is supposed to be a market for local farmers to showcase their fresh goods for people to select, buy, and use as they will. During my visit I saw a grand total of one local farmer (from Phil's somethingorother) selling produce - an itty bitty stand at that, with maybe 4 types of vegetables from which to choose. There were two or three other produce vendors, one of them the giant McClendon's, selling a boatload of attractive produce from California and Washington. Um...? I can get that at Whole Foods. There was some local olive oil with no prices listed (I'm sure it's fab, but with no advertised prices, and this being Scottsdale... uh uh).\\n\\nThere were prepared foods and goods and the like, but that's not what a farmer's market is for, nor is it what I seek in one. I didn't feel any communion with the vendors - some of them didn't seem to care much about what they were selling, or even know how it was grown and traveled from farm to farmer's market. McClendon's just looked like an outdoor grocery store, with multiple checkout lanes and everything. I doubt very much they could tell you the perfect time to pick that varietal of apple or how to best harvest this type of potato, much less have experience doing it themselves.\\n\\nI understand, this being Arizona and all, there's not a lot of prime agricultural land to be utilized. But things do grow here - prickly pear, anyone? Tomatoes? Melons? Citrus? Herbs? But nobody was selling those. Did I miss the part of the market where the actual market was?\\n\\nI give it a star for the McClendon's produce being affordable and attractive, a star because they have a couple of stands catering to pets, and a star because their prepared goods looked just fine. But minus a star for missing the point of a farmer's market, and minus a star for having next to 0 locally grown foods."}

{"_id": 0, "text": "First off I want to say to all the 1 star reviewers, you have my full sympathy! This place is so misleading it is unbelievable!!! My wife and I booked a two night stay here through Hotels.com because they advertised pretty well and the pictures didn't look too shaby at all. But we shure were fooled! When we arrived it turned out check in time wasn't till 3pm and they were understaffed apparently because the bell boy/girl was doing her job and tending their ridiculous bar! Anyways, when we got to our room it was literally not cleaned; the house keeping girl was (who looked like she was 16 years of age) still cleaning up our room! This made my wife and I real disappointed. I am usually against discrimination but for this review I have to say that when I go to a hotel I expect to see  housekeeping ladies (between her late 30's/40's)  with experience not  housekeeping girls who are barely 18 years of age that do a half ass job! \\n\\nBut going back to the room situation, we went back down to the front desk to get a new room. Once we mentioned to the front desk dude that are room wasn't even ready he put on this phony look of shock, which he probably wouldn't of displayed if there wasn't a line waiting to check in! So he told us he was sorry and gave us a new room which was supposed to be an \\\"upgrade\\\" from his words, trying to make us feel better. Though yet again, disapointment was on its way. The only real \\\"upgrade\\\" that we got in the new room is that we didn't find housekeeping in it! It was pretty much the same room as the first with just a slightly larger bed and only one dirty towel left in it! We tried our hardest to make the most of what we got for our money but in the end we still got ripped off on our $120 stay for two nights.\\n\\nSo don't be fooled about this joke of a hotel. The only \\\"Rumor\\\" about this hotel that should be floating around is how bad it is! And it shure as hell aint no \\\"Boutique\\\"!"}

{"_id": 3, "text": "First off, Dope Vapor does not sell starter kits as they only sell mechanical mods and rba's. So in my opinion, this isn't a bad thing, nor is it a good thing. For those who want to quit cigarettes, yes you get the full satisfying flavor and throat hit you can ask for, it's not expensive per say(as they sell replicas and clones), but it might be a little over someone's budget to just see if it'll really work for for them to kick the cigarettes.\\n\\nThey have 10 to 12 flavors, all of which are sweet. I don't mind this, but someone looking for a good tobacco or subtle flavor might think otherwise. Since i drip my juices, i sat down and tested the sample bottles. The way Dope Vapor lets you test their flavors are also by using a mech mod and rda, which is awesome because everyone knows or should know dripping brings out the flavor a lot more compared to a basic clearomizer that i see often in many other shops. Also, at the time the nicotine levels they carried were 0,3 and 6mg, most common levels for dripping. I personally like Pure Luck and Chronic Melons so give those a try if you stop by.\\n\\nThe person i spoke to during my visit is chill and laidback. We talked about unique coil builds he was working on and also about juices he was experimenting with. I enjoyed my time talking and tasting juices.\\n\\nPrices are good, i bought 5 juices and it came out to $25 + tax. the juices are 10ml each so 50ml for $25 isn't shabby at all for being local. Their clone mechanical mods are decently priced, not too sure of what manufacturer they carry though. But some of them seem to be from DHgate or FastTech not too sure.\\n\\nOverall, I had a pleasant experience. Staff is friendly, the shop is simple but effective. I get the fact he eliminated the starter kits so someone doesn't make the mistake of buying cheap starter kits, but maybe someone out there doesn't like big and bulky devices, or doesnt want to spend 100+(guestimating since you need a battery, charger, mod, rba and juice), and end up not liking it. Just my opinion of course. 4/5 stars Keep it up guys."}

The presentation of every single dish was impeccable.  \\n\\nWhen all was said and done, $130 or so including tip was more than worth our experience. \\n\\nIf you're looking for a high quality dining experience in Pittsburgh, look no further.

Since we were planning on seeing a movie, it seemed convenient.\\n\\nWe should've followed our instincts and turned around when we saw the skankily dressed and over made up waitresses smoking outside the back door.\\n\\nWe were given the option of inside, bar, or outside. We opted for outside, and loved the cell call service for when the table was ready. There was no mention or indication of there being a band on the patio.   The hostess put us on the same side of a sticky picnic table. We had to move a couple of smokers who were sitting on top of the table before we could sit down. Note, WE had to,the hostess did not. At that point we realized a band was about to start playing.  Luckily we were able to get prices and place a drink order before the screeching started.\\n\\nThe drinks and our appetizer of chips and salsa came quickly, but our waters did not.  The music was so loud we couldn't even focus on reading the menu.  We asked to be moved inside, and the waitress obliged. The hostess (also the manager?) came out to move us, and made it clear in her facial expressions that we were severely inconveniencing her. She took us inside, and I caught her rolling her eyes at a waitress as she re-seated us. \\n\\nAbout 15 minutes later, we finally had a waitress approach us. During this time we had discussed dropping some money on the table and leaving, but we were too hungry and figured the experience could only get better from here.  We couldn't have been more wrong.\\n\\nFirst request, the water we hadn't gotten yet.  We immediately placed our order, and it came out about 10 minutes later.  It was dropped by a surly food runner with zero personality. Water?  Still missing.  I was stuck sipping my weak margarita and by boyfriend had nearly finished his beer.\\n\\nWhen we were halfway done with our lukewarm meals, the waitress came to check on us.  Was she carrying water?  Nope.  Finally she followed through on something and brought them.\\n\\nDuring this time we were subjected to the horrible music coming in from outside.  I'm fairly certain the band's singer was both tone deaf and unable to keep a beat.  I have heard better music at last call in a backwoods karaoke bar.\\n\\nThe baja sauce was disgusting. It's basically watered down mayo with a little hot sauce mixed in.  I should've taken to heart their sign that said \\\"if  the food doesn't meet your standards, lower your standards.\\\"\\n\\nWell, we finished our meal and waited for our check....for nearly 25 minutes. Between the bad music, bad food, and bad service, we nearly left without paying. Its clear nobody would've noticed.  Since we have manners, I got up and asked the 4 waitresses standing around at the entry for our check, since our's was MIA. They scurried off, and I assumed they were finding her.  After ANOTHER 10 minutes, she finally showed up with the check. \\n\\nAND she had the nerve to say \\\"see you guys next time!\\\" Never again.  Save your time, save your money, save your ear drums.

I figure since they're franchises, the food at least would be consistent. I was so wrong!\\n\\nWe were seated very quickly and our server came over promptly. I told her to bring all the food out as soon as it's done and she said she understands because the kids will start to go crazy if sitting there for too long. We started off with a caprese salad but when it came out, the tomatoes were pinkish white, not red. When you're serving a salad with only 3 ingredients, every one of them needs to be perfect. The kids didn't want to eat his very adult salad so we asked for bread as well as a dish for the balsamic and olive oil. 15 minutes later, still no bread so we flag down the server and she finally brings it out to us. The dish never came. \\n\\n15 minutes later, our pizza comes out. We ordered a red pizza with spicy pepperoni and mushroom. The middle was wet, not crispy like the Grimaldis on Eastern. The cheese was chewy, so you had to just chew and eventually swallow it whole because it won't separate. My 4 year old who loves pizza said that it was terrible because the cheese keeps falling off of his floppy wet pizza. \\n\\nWhen we finished, we wanted to order the cookies and cream cheesecake but nobody looked at us for a very long time. After looking around, we realized that there was only one server, one manager, and three busboys for 15+ tables. It was ridiculous!! We sat there for so long that we decided not to get dessert and when we flagged somebody down, I just gave them my card without seeing the receipt because I didn't want to wait for them to pick up my card. When I got home and checked my bank account, I had two pending charges of the same amount from Grimaldis. \\n\\nIf we eat at Grimaldis again, we are making the drive to Henderson.

As soon as I sat, the waiter let me know that he was helping another table and would be right with me. Another person swept through and supplied some water and some warm bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Next, the waiter came by and recommended a nice Pinot Noir from the Russian River (excellent).  I ordered the Caesar Salad (average) for starters.  For the main course, I ordered the Bone In Ribeye (24oz) with the baked potato and grilled asparagus.  The steak was great! Way better than I expected: medium rare, very nice sear and tender. I didn't need to add any additional seasoning which was great.  It was probably one of the better steaks I have eaten in my short life here on this rock.  I took several pictures of Capt. Chaos posing on the steak!  He was impressed too. The asparagus was cooked just right and the potato was... a potato. All in all i was very happy with my meal and would most likely go back when/if i stay at Bally's in the future!\\n\\nWord"}

The chicken salad lacked any texture, more like mashed potatoes, and hardly any walnuts. It was not a generous sandwich--the only other toppings I recall were lettuce and tomato served on non-artisan bread. \\n\\nI had remembered the Paradise Bakery at Metrocenter of years ago, okay many years ago, and was impressed with their food then. This sandwich was just okay and the Mediterranean salad was pretty good.\\n\\nThe parking here is limited and driving through the congested area is a difficult.

The prices are very high and the portions are not very big.  So for the amount of food you get, the items are very overpriced.  Burgers, skewers, sandwiches and salads are all around 10, pizzas between 10-15.  Everything is a la carte and you get about 3 appetizer size skewers for the entrees.  Appetizers are about 10 as well, and desserts are 7 even with the option to add ice cream for 1.  \\n\\nI will say the burgers are better than the Grind - they actually stay together!  (the bun falls apart easily at the Grind and makes eating hard after a couple bites).  The fries were good ($5).  The pork skewers were passable but nothing special.  The Dorito potato skins were nothing special - just had a wedge of cheesy chip stuck in the middle of it.  The cupcake was good, but the chocolate was a little grainy.

My single and only complaint is with the Toro.  It is never the same quality from day to day (because they never know what they are going to get), and if you are at ALL a fan of tuna, you want the stuff that just melts in your mouth.  It just boggles the mind to be served a piece that's all stringy and white after having already had the highest grade Toro.  There is a \\\"grading scale\\\" for the belly tuna - be sure to ask before ordering if it's the top grade that day.  Otherwise, skip it and order something else.  Preferably the Stardust, so you can taste the outrageously good yum yum sauce...  \\nTheir tempura is pretty good too, with a fairly light crust on it.  I've had some heavy handed tempura at other places, and those are NOT good.  The teriyaki salmon is delish - not too tangy, not too sweet.  Overall, everything I've had on the menu has been wonderful.  Be prepared to wait if you go at dinnertime, but we always thought ahead to get takeout so we could just grab it and go."}

{"_id": 1, "text": "I went to Bikram Yoga for two weeks straight, attending 5 to 6 days out of the week. Some days I loved it, other days I was counting down the time in my head for the class to end. The same 26 postures can be boring at times, but it's almost nice to have a routine. But then I wonder why the hell am I paying money when I can practice the postures at home. \\n\\nThe heat didn't bother me at all; it actually cleared up my skin. The humidity does wonders for my skin during the dry winter months. I was not a fan of the carpet, especially when you're lying in savasana and all I can think about is the stench, bacteria, BO, sweat, and who knows what permeating from the floor. The fluorescent lights in the room were god-awful as well. The studio could definitely improve on their atmosphere. \\n\\nAs for the instructors, I had varying degrees of loving them, and hating them. I loved Zeb. He was very nice and encouraging. I wish he instructed all of the classes. There was one instructor who I had a class with at 6am. She kept apologizing for being \\\"bossy,\\\" and yes, she was very bossy and rude. She was rude when I walked in and slightly less rude when I walked out. She kept picking on this one poor student. He was older and couldn't do the moves as well. I felt bad for him and her \\\"constructive criticism\\\" of him was distracting. She nit picked even if you were slightly off on your posture (for instance, she yelled at me because I was grabbing my ankles instead of my heels). She had a very type A personality and it did not flow well with my bikram practice. I guess she just wasn't my style of instructor. I'll give the instructors this though: it's nice to have someone guide you to improve your poses whereas I found other studios just didn't give a damn what you did. I just wish they would give guidance rather than rude criticism. \\n\\nThe clientele is elitist. People wear speedos and bathing suits, which I don't understand. Yes, it's incredibly hot and humid, but is being half naked really necessary? Meh, whatever floats their boat, but it's another distraction in my practice. \\n\\nAnd the instructors don't want you to drink water or have hand towels to wipe off sweat because they are \\\"distractions,\\\" which is complete BS to me. Water is necessary and I don't care what anyone says. If you're sweating profusely in a 100F room for 90min straight, you need water for your health's sake. It doesn't even matter if you hydrate before class, a sip of cold water can do wonders during practice and your likelihood of burning out or quitting is decreased. The true distractions are the smelly carpet, awful lighting, rude instructors, half naked students, and elitist attitude. \\n\\nI love bikram yoga itself; the tendonitis in my knee is completely relieved. I would practice bikram every day if the studio and people were nicer. I'll probably visit the studio every now and then, but it's not somewhere I would recommend for every day practice."}

I roll up to the window, and hand the cashier a $5 plus a coupon for one free drink.  I'd assume that she'd take off the most expensive one, or at least ask, but no, she didn't ask.  So I was expecting about $1 plus change, and was surprised when the cashier gave me $.18.  I questioned which drink she took off, wondering why the venti wasn't the free drink.

She insisted that yes they did.  Of course, she proceeded to hand me the receipt, I saw that was false (which I already knew).  Yes, it was only a dollar, but this was a complete and utter customer service failure.

{"_id": 1, "text": "The second I came in to Au Petit Four I was really hoping to have a wonderful breakfast. Located in the old town area, I thought that a small, family-owned french breakfast place would be the perfect refreshing break from the trendy (Read: untsss unttsss untss music) mimosa-brunch places and overly-priced-food restaurants. I wanted something fresh, homemade, french and delicious.\\n\\nWe ordered an iced latte, a nutella crepe with fresh fruit and whipped cream, a croissant with egg and sausage and a normandy creme (ham, cheese and egg). The food came in before the waters and drinks, and unfortunately, they seemed prepared ahead of time and left to sit.\\n\\nMy normandy crepe looked (visually) delicious. When I started digging in, I noticed that it was a little cold (aka not prepared fresh) and that the cheese was barely there and already solidified and not gooey. The flavors were ok but the crepe contents were very flat, so they were very stingy on the portions of their ingredients. The crepe was topped with a sunny side-up egg but had no sauce or added flavors to it. I tried adding hot sauce but it really didn't make the dish any better. That was about $8. My iced latte was approximately $5 and really tasted like coffee with whole milk - and the coffee was not a great quality. Not an enjoyable meal.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the nutella crepe but was delivered a crepe stuffed with fresh fruit instead. Apparently, the order is EITHER a fruit crepe or a nutella crepe, not a nutella crepe served with fruit. When they took it back, they returned the same plate with a hint of nutella placed on top (my friend has already cut into the crepe earlier). The whipping cream was not your typical type: it was very dense and heavy, a weird combo between whipped cream and thick evaporated milk.\\n\\nThe service was decent but we were the only people at the restaurant besides from 2 other ladies who were just having coffee. The place was very empty, which is sad to see considering the 3 breakfast places adjacent to it had a 30-40min waiting line. I really want Au Petit Four to succeed but they need to overhaul the quality of their food and the attentiveness of their staff. With no customers to make them busy, there is no excused for stingy cold food."}

I suddenly realized that the only thing I had to eat was popcorn at the movie and that was over 4 hours ago.  So, I stated to think about what was at the Marketplace in terms of being \\\"kid free\\\" and having a decent dinner.  \\n\\nI don't mind dining alone but on a Saturday evening when there are lots of families and dates going on, I'd rather not sit in the dining room alone so I bellied up to the bar.  It was pretty empty.  There was one other guy at the bar so I figured the bar tender would see me pretty fast.  Not the case, I waited about 5 minutes before I was acknowledged by someone other than the bartender.  I asked for some water and told him I was looking over the drink menu, not sure what I wanted yet.  Another 5 minutes went by and the bar tender came over, I ordered my drink and he asked if I would be having dinner.  I said yes so he got a menu.  I was somewhat taken aback by the prices.  I thought it was a tad bit expensive.  Since it was just me and I was giving myself a treat I thought, ok, just once.....unless it is just amazing bbq....you never know.  I finally made my decision and ordered 1/2 slab of baby back ribs.....it's bbq and that's usually how I gauge my bbq, by the ribs.  \\n\\nMy food came out piping hot.  The roll that was severed with the meal was flaky on the outside and tender inside.  The cinnamon butter was delish and a nice compliment.  I was never asked if I wanted another though.  I dug into the mac and cheese and it was hot and gooey with a nice flavor.  I got sweet potato fries too.....I know, I love carbs!  Wish I didn't but I don't have many vices.  :)  Those were tasty as well, hot and crisp. And now for the ribs. They were good.  Moist and tender, fall off the bone goodness.  The sause had a tiny bit of sweetness to it that I liked.  The Dbacks were playing the Dodgers and not doing so well so I took solice in my ribs.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere here is cute.  Down home southern style and comfy.  They had a blues combo playing in the bar and they were pretty darn good I must say.  The music made me feel better about watching the Dbacks loose to the Dodgers.  UGH!  \\n\\nThe service was just ok. Considering I was one of just two other people at the bar,   I could have been greeted faster.  I had a margarita that tasted a bit off to me.  And I felt that was pretty expensive too.  The food was good but for the price I can go other places and get something just as good.  In this economy I've got to save my pennies.  I also thought the service was lacking.  I would not have been pleased at all if I had been in the dining room.  But then again, one of two people at the bar and I wasn't greeted with a minute?  Not sure I will go back.....but thanks anyway."}

I think there might be other vegan-friendly ones on the menu but I can't be sure. Anyway, the wrap is very good, even when you get it vegan with mustard instead of mayo. They do something to the tofu that makes it authentically smoky and delicious. Other than the wow factor of the tofu the rest of the meal is very much good but not great. But that's kind of Graze's deal--basic food done well with a consistent locavore ethic. \\n\\nBrunch was much better than lunch, however. The scrambled tofu ranks high, even though as a vegan in Madison I am a little sick of that being my only option at most places for brunch. Regardless, it is very good (the sauce was spicy and savory and oh so-delicious). It was served with an abundant bed of fresh greens with a simple and satisfying vinaigrette. The potatoes, were the stars of the meal, however (as they are with all breakfast dishes done proper). Very crispy and salty. \\n\\nI paired this with a local craft brew (some kind of Rye APA). \\n\\nGraze is a standby in my eating out rotation. It is fancy enough to go for a business lunch, yet laid back enough to take your mom out for a nice brunch.  Their food is simple but tasty.

I have to say I was not hungry, but tried the BLT burger.  The burger was prepared perfectly to a medium temperature and had a nice crust of salt and pepper on it.  The smoked bacon was a bit overpowering but good.  My biggest complaint is the complete lack of condiments.  No ketchup, mustard or mayo.  We had to request it and for a table of 6, two small ketchup cups were brought out, so we had to request them 6 times to get enough to go around.  Duck fat fries were okay.\\n\\nI was also disappointed to not see other meats for burgers.  Where's the bison, ostrich, or my ever favorite lamb burger?  (I am still the self proclaimed king of lamb burgers).  Also, I am of the camp where you season both the inside and outside of the burger... I typically blend meats for my burgers, and add herbs, spices, etc to enhance the flavor.  You just get meat here (which some people prefer).\\n\\nMy bottom line is this will be a nice neighborhood hangout, with a great bar and well above average food for a bar, but it's not worth a drive."}

{"_id": 4, "text": "A gorgeous park for us lucky locals! It has been my top 2 favorite parks in Summerlin for years. \\n\\nThis beautiful wash park is great for walking/running/biking, picnic, kids playing, walking the dogs, soccer and basketball practice...and even \\\"Hiking\\\"! Yes, hiking, too! Read on, if interested.\\n- Oh yes, this park is very well maintained by the landscape crew and patrolled by the park security. The entire park is wheelchair accessible.\\n\\n- Its paved path, with pleasant views of the washbeds and the nice houses on the banks above, stretches out to 1.7 gentle miles long from the main Entrance on Lake Mead (west side of Buffalo) to the Rampart end. \\n\\n- There are TWO beautiful, large grass lawns (on each side of Pueblo Vista), several covered pavilions with grills and picnic tables, three playgrounds, a small basketball court...even a small corner with \\\"fitness exercise stations\\\" in the open rest area/playground by the Rampart end.\\n- There are plenty of places for resting. Besides pavilions, there are also park benches thoughtfully placed every 0.25mi or so on the path for you to enjoy the beauty of the park in peace! At the Rampart end by the golf course, there are 2 more small rest courts on each side the overpass/tunnel, one of which has a chessboard on its table.\\n-  It has bathroom facilities by the front entrance side. For the Rampart side, there is no restroom, but one could use the facility in the Trent Park Sports Complex on Vegas/Rampart, 0.2mi up.\\n- For parking, besides the lots beyond the main entrance off Lake Mead, there are parking spaces also on Pueblo Vista St (off Lake Mead), right above the tunnel/overpass, nearby the Lutheran Church and school. There are paved paths off the street overpass leading into the park.\\n\\nSOMETHING EXTRA:\\n- To extend the walking distance, one can branch out by going up and down the paths to/from resident areas. For even greater distance, you can also walk another 0.2mi on Vegas towards Rampart to get into the \\\"Trent Park Sports Complex\\\" around the corner. BTW: This park is worth a visit, too. \\n\\n- For the more adventurous, one can \\\"hike\\\" on several sections of WASH BEDS and/or on the upper DIRT Trails along the school fence or along the perimeters of the residential wall - it'd be almost like HIKING! (see pics). \\n- Enjoy your \\\"HIKE\\\" but do be CAREFUL and stay clear of areas where there are watering dripper/sprinklers, and have a good pair of walking/hiking shoes.\\n\\nBTW: I noted that Yelper Daniel S. had already given an outstanding review on this park a few months back, which is informative and a pleasure to read!\\n- Here, I really just wanted to add that in Pueblo, one can ALSO (1) do some \\\"In-City Hiking\\\" and (2) extend walking distance.\\n\\nPeterskis, Nov 2012\\n----"}

We were seated quickly by a friendly hostess, and greeted by a polite server, who oddly, disappeared in the middle of our meal and was replaced with a nice waitress.  It must have been a shift change since were there during the middle of the day, but the swap was never explained to us, which seemed a bit odd.\\n\\nThe drinks were good.  I had a Moscow Mule while my husband had a craft beer.  Both were served cold and within 5 minutes of being seated.  My husband had a burger while I had a light shrimp cocktail.  My husband really enjoyed his burger, but the fries were the star of the meal.  They were definitely plentiful, and enough to share between the two of us.  So delicious!  The shrimp cocktail was okay, it didn't taste as fresh as others I have had in Vegas, and for the $24 price tag, it definitely was on the very steep end considering the portion size and overall quality.  \\n\\nWe would consider going here again, but I will definitely try another chilled seafood item from the raw menu - which was pretty impressive for a pub specializing in hearty fare.

We polished them off pretty quickly.  Then our entrees came out, and our small two seater table was suddenly crowded.  No one - not the food runner, nor our server who walked by us three times - thought to take away the big empty platter from the middle of our table.  \\n\\nWe had just started in on our tacos when the waiter finally came back to the table - but not to ask if we were okay, give us more water, or take away the platter - to hand us the check.

We had wanted dessert, but obviously he was in a rush to get us out of there for some reason.

{"_id": 4, "text": "Oh BLT how I love thee. You are one of those restaurants that my mind wonders to on a hungry day. You are a restaurant that I think about when I want a restaurant with an atmosphere and view of Camelback Mountain. And with your bar and indoor/outdoor seating arrangements, you are the perfect place to enjoy a meal on a warm or cool day.\\n\\nI've dined at BLT twice and I think I will be setting up a sleeping bag and just living there from now on. Most recently, I went last night for my birthday. When asked to pick my restaurant poison for the unbirthday celebration, I didn't have to think twice before saying BLT. I wasn't disappointed. The restaurant was full with people but not overly crowded. Our table was ready upon arrival and situated just by the patio and overlooking the mountains so a perfect mixture of indoor outdoor seating. The service was a bit on the slow side but I enjoyed that since this was a leisurely dinner and not one you want to get rushed. The waiter definitely gave us our time. After beginning with wine (a must at a Steakhouse of course), we were served my very favorite classic starter -- popovers! They were large in charge and full of buttery taste. I could probably go back for the popovers alone. For the meal, my table chose between the classic steak and the sole. I went with the sole and to insert much needed awful puns here...I felt the soul train after just one bite! How do I describe it. Upon taking a bite, I tasted candied pecan. As random as it sounds, it tasted delicious. It was a good amount of sole and due to the heaviness of the sauce (delicious sauce by the way), I couldn't finish it as much as I tried. I know I'll be dreaming about the sole for years to come. Plus, since this is not a restaurant you visit for a random Tuesday night and the dollar signs exceed $$$, I will be dreaming for awhile but it's a good memory to have! \\n\\nMoving on to dessert, we tasted a bit of everything and the cheesecake was tasty. I ordered an apple crisp tart and it was ok, but the entree was definitely the highlight of the evening. The only awkward moment of the night was that since it was my birthday, my table apparently tried to tell the staff three times and put the note on the reservation. But, alas three reminders later, still no birthday candle on a dessert (which was fine by me since I like to avoid the birthday if at all possible but my table wouldn't let it slide.) Finally after one final awkward reminder, just as we were ready to go and plates had practically been cleared, a random chocolate souffle appeared with happy birthday. Still no candle and the moment was kind of over but the thought still counts. So I'd probably say this was a great birthday spot for me since I don't enjoy the birthday candle as much, but if you visit and that's important to you, you may want to get on that as early in the dinner as possible! \\n\\nNow that I am officially full for the weekend, I will never forget my great birthday experience at BLT and I definitely think this is a restaurant you should consider for a special occasion. \\n\\nOne last thing -- the mixologist for cocktails is amazing and she knows her bourbon, so if she's working the night you visit, definitely ask her for a special drink!"}

You can even watch them make the crepes right in front of you.  \\n\\nOn my first visit I had the Rebel Special - strawberries, banana, and Nutella - how can  you go wrong? I chose to have vanilla ice cream on mine and was not disappointed. The crepe was light and a perfect compliment to the filling. My husband had the bananas foster - banana, brown sugar, cinnamon, and caramel - my only wish was that the filling was warm. \\n\\nOn our next visit I was craving apple pie, did I mention I was nine months pregnant? They had the perfect solution, the apple a la mode - apple, sugar, cinnamon, caramel, and graham cracker. It was almost like a slice of pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Again, I wished that the filling was warm, but it definitely hit the spot and quelled my pregnancy craving. \\n\\nI am excited to try out some of the other combinations, I get the feeling you can't go wrong. I love that you can easily eat them without utensils, you just bite right in. This is a light and delicious treat that won't leave you feeling guilty, so go give it a try! Oh and get the punch card, you'll need it!"}

When the food did come out it was either half cold and rubbery (chicken). They ran out of wine that we ordered and gave us excuses that they were really busy.

Strange.\\n\\nNow I might update my review of them later since their service although good, was a bit inattentive at times, and it was crowded beyond belief.  Probably due to the Luke Bryan concert going on at the Red Rock that night.  Yeah yeah, I know.  I was like... Luke who? (some country singer for those that don't know).

{"_id": 2, "text": "I was intrigued by this new food truck the minute I heard of it. The name is funny and the gimmick is cute. When I saw on Facebook they would be at the public market today, I was really excited and decided to try them out. Yes...I know it is over 100 degrees...but pho is awesome! So the BF and I went to the Phoenix Public Market and the truck was there. I got the pho ga (8$) and the BF got a grilled cheese (lol). I asked them if it was in a container I could carry for a few blocks and they said yes. Then we proceeded to wait for a really long time. Now, I know they are a new truck, but the wait time was pretty long for soup and grilled cheese. When we got the food, the pho was in about a quart sized styrofoam container with no lid and the sammich was on a plate....ok....I suppose I can walk with that. Anyway, by the time I had gotten home, the noodles had soaked up a lot of the broth making it sort of a mushy mess. I think maybe they need to have a different game plan for people taking the food to go like most pho places (e.g. noodles in a container, broth in a separate container). The pho was not flavorful enough and needs more depth....the broth was kind of bland and no amount of jalapeno and basil helped and I expected more than that (especially for 8$ when you can get a much larger bowl of pho at Pallets down the street for the same price or a larger bowl anyplace in Seattle for around 4$). The grilled cheese was good. Anyway, I was sort of disappointed....it seems that this place is more gimmick than substance. Maybe they just need more time to get the kinks out, but I don't think I would go out of my way to eat at this truck again."}

The service was great and our waiter was very good about coming back to check on us even though there was a huge party on the other side of the restaurant that he was also assisting. Good service.\\n\\nThe food was okay. We got the Quattro Forno dish which is four different kinds of stuffed shells including manicotti, ravioli, shells and canolli. The food was cooked well and it had good flavor but it was not anything that I would go out of my way to have again. We also got a small order of cheesy garlic bread which could have stood to be cooked a little longer. It tasted good but got cold really fast and no one likes cold bread.\\n\\nI do not recommend coming here with just two people. The family style dishes are huge even if you just get one small order between two people. They probably gave us 20 large pieces of garlic bread which we definitely could not finish and garlic bread does not reheat well so I felt like I was just wasting it. I would recommend coming here with a party of four or more.\\n\\nNot sure if I will be back. Maybe if I have a large party and we need a lot of food for a certain occasion."}

The size of National is perfect for shows - standing room on the floor is maybe 400?

The coat check is at the back of the main room, and the bar is in the lobby - both feel sort of oddly placed but not in a bad way. Drinks aren't crazy over priced and all the staff I've encountered have been super funny and nice. The sound is fairly good, and I think better for warmer, more acoustic shows. \\n\\nThe building itself is stunning.

Lots of pools, golf course and workout center. 3.) The bad: 1.) Room service: ordered a very standard breakfast that arrived late and the order was wrong. 2.) The hotel has several restaurants on the property that look great...however they may or may not be open depending on who is staying at the hotel that week. 3.) All the rooms are spread out all over the property...so someone elderly especially would have a challenge going from point a to b on foot. 4.)

{"_id": 3, "text": "I recently spend a grand old weekend in Vegas for my birthday with a few girlfriends. I was left in charge of finding and booking the place to stay..so I was feeling a little bit of pressure since I always talk about how much a read and review things... I finally choose THEhotel. It seemed to be the most upscale for not as steep of a price as the Bellaggio and Caesars. Having a suite is almost perfect so after weeks of reading reviews and asking people on Twitter, THEhotel it was. I stayed in \\\"THEsuite\\\" and was very happy with the room and hotel. Ladies this is the perfect room to get if there are a few ladies staying together. I swore that the room was designed by a woman, there were just too many little things that we noticed and appreciated that we felt there was no way a man could have designed it. First off, the additional half bath is perfect and the double sinks and ample storage space in the bathroom make you feel very at home...at home in luxurious home that is. There was even separate closets where we both were able to unpack all our dresses and shoes and have our own space, very nicely done. The beds are very comfortable and the concierge is completely helpful in suggestions and helping with bookings or questions, I called them a million times and every time I was greeted and helped so well. I love the door bell on the rooms, call me silly but I just it made everything seem more at home. \\n\\nThere were a few things I noticed that frustrated me, but not too much to where I would not stay again. Upon check in there was no \\\"nonsmoking\\\" rooms left even though I booked online and called to make sure the reservation said no smoking. The staff told us we could move the next day, but by then all my stuff was unpacked and I had bigger fish to fry. Second, after coming in a 6 or 7 like the usual in Vegas, I really really need coffee; I understand some people have money and don't pay attention to the prices but $6 for a cup of coffee in the room? I just couldn't do it. Coffee should always be free everywhere. Third, I wish there was a mini fridge in the room for personal use and not just holding the $15 drinks. \\n\\nOverall, I will probably always stay here. Great housekeeping and room service (the nachos have like 4 blocks of cheese on them watch out!) the rooms are amazing and we got lots of compliments on it from visitors. It being attached to Mandalay bay is great, so you can get the best of both worlds, a nice luxury hotel but you can also walk to gaming and bars in a flash. If you have a few extra bucks I would encourage the splurge for THEhotel."}

A lot of time and thought went into the decor, and it shows, if you like the watered down idea of tiki. (I liked the artwork.) There was just no....soul. When I think of tiki, I see over the top.

The wireless is PAINFULLY slow (like dial-up slow), the gym costs $20/day and is akin to a cheap 1980s Jane Fonda era place with mainly broken down machines, the towels are like dishrags, the food is horrendous in both the Buffet and the restaurants I tried, the bottled water is $4, etc.  Hell, the wakeup call service is completely ridiculous and the HD TV does not have any HD channels with it. Clearly, Hilton has given up on this place and no investment is being made to do any upgrades to anything. \\n\\nMainly, it is full of drunk, chain smoking rednecks stumbling around the hotel and it is on the FAR end of the Strip so don't expect to walk anywhere.  Go to the Wynn or the Bellagio if you can foot the bill or try the Paris or MGM as they usually have some decent room rates."}

The grounds are well kept and breathtakingly beautiful.  It's very quiet and relaxing.\\n\\nI'm not sure what the other reviewers were talking about when they said they had a problem taking cameras in.  We had cameras, as did everyone else we saw inside.

Oh well, after cleaning and washing everything even close to the fish I figured I would drown my sorrows in some baby backs. I threw a rub on them along with the tri tip and put them in the smoker.

Try the carnitas torta - it is absolutely divine and ginormous. Don't forget to pick up a few roasted jalape\\u00f1os at the salsa bar for a smokey, spicy kick. Its one of those meals that you get and think there is no possible way you could finish it, but then you probably finish it anyway.

I had the Santan Brew Devil's Ale because they were out of the IPA, but I was pleased to find that the Devil was still hoppy and a good pairing with pizza... flavorful but not too strong. The pizza... man oh man the pizza. Definitely the best thin crust I've ever had. The cooking technique gives it a very nice crispy outside but soft inside. The cheese is always fresh mozzarella and both the traditional red sauce and white garlic are great. All the ingredients are fresh and tasty and worth the money. My last visit left me wanting more sausage but that's a small discrepancy in a solid track record. At the very least give it a try and if it falls short it's all good... it's just pizza people.\\n\\nOh almost forgot, the Canoli are awesome! Maybe slightly overpriced for the size, but well made and decadent."}

We went for dinner after drinking downtown around 7pm and was told there was a 30min wait and we'll receive a text once our table was ready. We go to a bar to waste time and 45mins later we receive a text so we return. Once we are seated a woman who said she was part owner tells us that the restaurant is \\\"very busy tonight and you'll need to be done within a hour\\\" and she continues to tell us about the table of 14 that's eating and it being a small kitchen. Mind you they weren't slammed. Our waiter takes our order (still no drinks) and it took so long that we had to ask him after 45 mins where it was. We're now sarcastically thinking, \\\"Well does the hour start now since we received our food or what?\\\" We then ask to speak to the manager about the lack of service and the lady comes back over!!! Ugh! We tell her about our experience and remind her of how rude she was to us and she says there's no way she can compensate us in any way. Smh.

My wife first introduced me to this place by bringing it home one night for dinner. It was horrible; but I chalked this up to what I ordered (a dish that was a cross between Mexican and Italian food) and the fact that it was cold from the drive home. So when we were in the area we decided to go in and sit down for a meal and enjoy the atmosphere. Well enjoy I did...nothing says a nice night out to dinner like tables covered with paper and plastic cups for you can drink (don't adjust your screen; this is not a review for Peter Piper Pizza). But hey, I am not a snob; I love places that save on the little things so they can put it in the food. But sadly this was not the case; it was not the worst Italian I have ever had, I am old enough to remember Wendy's super bar with fettuccine alfredo and hamburger bun bottoms cut in half and slathered in garlic butter. But for the price and the hype it was strike two; I had a Caesar salad and a pasta in cream sauce; both decent portions but nothing to write home about in the end. The service was poor, we did not get the specials but luckily we heard it given to the table beside us (just not lucky enough to have this happen before we ordered). We also ordered bread with our entrees but it never came out. I think my wife summed up our service experience best when she said that at the very least she expected the waiter to pour her can Coke into her plastic cup for her. The bill came and I found myself paying top dollar for mediocre food and poor service; strike three, ball game."}

The food took about an hour to show up, which isn't that bad. What was bad were the fries, which were nowhere near being done. They were a wet, soggy mess and a total write off. The chicken fingers tasted like they were frozen, microwaved, then brought to us an hour later. To cap things off, this whole debacle cost $20. We asked for a couple extra ranch dips, they charged us a buck each for three of them. Then they charged us $9.99 for the chicken (even though we confirmed the $6.99 price 3 times on the phone) and $2.99 for the uncooked fries. Add the delivery charge and tip and we were left $20 poorer and still hungry 90 minutes later. Based on this experience I wouldn't dare try ordering a pizza or anything else from here."}

His mom was a missionary in Korea when she was younger, so she introduced her family to this style of food when they were young.  They LOVE the kimchi, bulgogi, and bibimbop (sorry if those are mispelled).  His mother says their food is the closest to the food she had when in Korea.  One thing they said they would appreciate, is for each person who orders one of the dishes that comes with the kimchi to get their own portions of them.\\nI'm a fan of the sushi. Some of it is pretty pricey, but most of it is reasonable.  We also love the crab rangoon.  It's easy to share with a group because it's made differently than anywhere else I've been.  The crab/cream cheese filling is actually served in a dish as a dip.  The fried pastry is cut in triangles, like chips!  \\nI don't like that the chairs feel cheap and unstable (think ikea) and the tables are tight for 6 tops.

Don't get me wrong, it is ALWAYS good, but it should be served in a timely fashion!  Last time we were there, there were maybe 3 or 4 other tables there and it took about 45 minutes to get our food...and they only brough 4 of the 6 of us our food at that time...the other 2 people got their food another 15 minutes later!

Literally at 7:01 AM the doorbell rang.  I had makeup done by Celina & hair by Courtney.  I had my m/u done first.  I showed her various pictures of what I was looking for and didnt look like any of the sample pictures, nor did I like my look at all.  I didn't get a good look at myself because right after she finished, I went to the hair chair.  It was only until after that I noticed that:\\na) my got tons of glue on my lower lashes\\nb) my foundation was uneven\\nc) my blush and eyeshadow weren't blended perfectly, so there were harsh lines\\nspectacular.  \\nd) some of my eyeliner was sparse and moving\\n\\nI did the airbrush foundation.  I didn't like it.  It looked like a lighter coverage that what I normally use and that's tinted moisturizer.  It didn't rub off on my clothes.\\n\\nMIT 702 makes strong claims about how they are the \\\"only\\\" co. that does a lot of things, so I want to be clear on what they do provide.\\n\\nThey offer a touch up to go kit.  This kit consists of a sponge for face, an eyeshadow applicator and a free lipgloss.  I don't use powder regularly and she recommended I use powder to keep my face looking good for so many hours, so I had to get my cousin to make a quick trip to sephora.  \\n\\nRegarding the lipgloss, it wasn't a color I would have chosen, but literally she had a dozen tubes of this \\\"universally flattering\\\" lipgloss that she gave to me, my mom & my mother-in-law.  My mom actually refused to wear it because she felt awkward having the same color as me & used her own lipstick instead.  The lipgloss definitely wasn't 15 hr proof, it was gone after I had my first glass of champagne in the limo & nonexistent in 90% of the pictures.\\n\\nAs for the lashes, I used my own because the ones they had were super long & looked too fake.  Re the lasting of the makeup, I was done at 10:15AM & got home just past midnight.  My eye makeup was still on, but had caked, my blush & foundation looked a bit sloppy.  I did have a long day, sweated, etc.\\n\\nMy mom hated her makeup.  She said that the one time I did her makeup looked a lot better than what they did.  I didn't think my mom looked any better than when she normally does her makeup (& she is hard of seeing).\\n\\nMy mother-in-law looked great.  Celina seemed hesitant to use lashes on her bc her natural lashes are so blond and she has light hair, but she was excited about them, so used them anyway.  She looked good.  She didn't look over the top or anything, a very natural look, which is similar to what she normally wears.  \\n\\nHair\\nMy mom has thinning hair & I had e-mailed ahead to let them know this.  She usually uses a product to add fullness and forgot it in NY.  I also emailed ahead about this.  The stylist (Courtney) emailed me back telling me to check out Sally's for the product but we didn't have enough time.  She did was she could, but unfortunately the product she had was grey and my mom had light brown hair with dark low lights.  Considering the circumstances, her hair looked good & held up throughout the day & night.  She wanted to add some brown, but the makeup artist said the only way would be to break an eyeshadow and she didn't want to do that because she didn't think it was worth it.  She also said this after going on about how she buys all types of things and writes them off on her taxes.  It isn't how I would have acted in her position, but completely understand her stance, though she could have been more professional in her wording & demeanor.\\n\\nDespite telling me she couldn't do my hair in the fashion that Megan had told me was a go, she still did a good job.  My hair held well throughout the day and I was able to work it a little into what I wanted for the night.\\n\\nMy mother in law's hair was fantastic.  She has beautiful, thick, luxurious & plentiful hair, so admittedly was a great canvas to work with, but her hair was great & lasted the entire day.\\n\\nMy only commentary regarding the hair is that we all had the same colored bobby pins used on us and given to us for \\\"touch ups,\\\" yet my mother in law has blond and red hair, my mother has light to medium brown hair and my hair is jet black.\\n\\nOverall, these girls were both on time, super chipper & friendly.  I would rate hair an A- and makeup a C, at best.  Another additional commentary is that Celina, the makeup artist was done before Courtney the stylist was done.  She collected the money & said she had a day full of bookings so had to be on the go.  This is why I wasn't able to point out issues with my makeup to her.  Courtney stayed about a good 30 mins after that.  I thought this was weird & unprofessional.  \\n\\nThey sent me emails to write reviews on wedding sites, when I did, the review was disputed, so beware of what may be a false positive in the rankings.

We often eat there for about $20 including drinks for 4. \\nThe food is tasty, at least what I have tried, steak kabob, various standard sides, chips are homemade are some of the best I have ever had plus the teas are quite good, not too sweet.\\nCons: the person behind the counter either makes it or breaks it. We have been here 3 times and it's been inconsistent as far as portion sizes are concerned and personality of the server. I have never been offered a sample but have seen numerous other people offered. \\nSeems like a bunch of young unsupervised kids work there. The bad part of that is you don't know what you will get when you dine there. \\nStill I give it four stars because it is tasty every time."}

{"_id": 3, "text": "I'd give this place five stars, but they made me mad by firing two of their COOLEST employees! Grr! I do not concur with the company policy that lead to their joining the ranks of the unemployed, because they had some seriously top-notch recommendations for the adventurous beer drinker. It was through their recommendations that I sampled some of Lee's better offerings and their loss is sorely missed.\\n\\nOn the other hand, I AM a girl who enjoys herself some booze, so I will continue shopping here. However, I'm hard pressed to put a can of MGD or 'Bud' to my lips and actually enjoy. If I have any say in the matter what-so-ever, I'd do a jig and a half to have a Leinenkugels Sunset Wheat or a Hoegaarden, a Dogfish Head Raison D'Etre or even a Negro Modelo instead. I like beer, and I like beer with flavor. Not a donkey-punch to the tongue bitter, of course, but something with a distinctive flavor that sets it apart from the water. \\n\\nLee's has a vast selection of unique beers to choose from, including Delerium Nocturnum and Delirium Noel, which are both delicious. There are also lots of European imports and microbrew beers worth trying. I like that individual large bottles are available, making it easier to sample flavors that may otherwise be too intimidating to buy in a whole 6 pack. Banana Bread beer, Chocolate Stout or Orange Creme anyone?  \\n\\nThere are also aisles and aisles of wines, flavored liquors and mixers. There are so many flavors and varieties to choose from, including Absinthe and awesome bar-stockers like high quality Tequilas, Italian liquors, etc. If I had my way, I'd stock up a huge surplus of bottles to experiment with various cocktails.  \\n\\nAlso, they have Cock n' Bull Ginger Beer, which is delicious and I recommend trying it. It's a non-alcoholic, fizzy, sharp ginger bite in a glass bottle. I'd like to make a cocktail with it sometime. \\n\\nThe prices are pretty reasonable, especially for their beers and the hours are pretty normal, closing at either 9 or 10 pm. It'd be nice if they were open later, but c'est la vie. \\n\\nSo if you need something to drink and are feeling a little adventurous, stop in and look around. There's bound to be something you'd like, even if it's a fuzzy navel wine cooler."}

The the south point member club sends out $15-50 In free slot play about once a month.\\n2. The oyster bar has a good deal on King Crab legs.\\n3. The Bowling ally is awesome and is 24 hours\\n\\nDowns:\\n1. Walking into this place is like walking into a 12x12 room full of marlboro testers on full puff status... Plan on having second hand cancer when you leave and plan on having a soar throat for a few days after leaving.\\n2. I understand that coctail waitresses are assigned the uniforms... So come on South Point, is it really fair for those poor girls to be forced to have a 3 inch thick piece of cloth pulled up there ass and the sides cut up to thier arm puts.... All i can say is this is not flattering. \\\"if you are a c octail waitress there please understand I am not talking about your lack of appeal, but the wrestling singlets that you are forced to wear just dont do any favors\\\"\\n3. The slots, in my opinion are very very tight, they boast the %97 payback rate on video poker but that means nothing to me. Thats a %97 payback rate based on an infinate amount of time.\\n\\nMaybe i am being a little harsh on the place, and i know my main complaint is the smoke..

Yes, they are very busy, but this does not excuse the mediocre service and dirty tables on a regular basis. This location seems to be the preferred spot for local cabbies and you can almost always count on a 8-10 person line, which is fine and does not factor into my 2 star rating for this Starbucks. What DOES affect my rating are at the following\\n\\n1) Consistently dirty tables, floors, and restroom. You can almost always count on having empty cups, spilled milk/half and half, sugar, etc both on the tables and on the straw/napkin area. Seems like perhaps a lack of proper staffing and/or lack of awareness.\\n\\n2) Compared to other Starbucks, staff seems extremely smug and unhappy except for 2 or 3 employees. Yes, we know it's busy and this location is probably more difficult than other locations, but you have a great job and are consistently busy. \\n\\n3) Regardless of how complicated your drink is, you are PAYING good money for it. My drink is almost $7 and I have at least 5 per week. No other location has ever had an issue making it, yet here, \\\"Ben\\\" the barista, seemed to have a problem with how the drink was ordered and when he called it out at the bar, he used a very smug and sarcastic tone which is NOT appreciated.

{"_id": 2, "text": "Admittedly, Shauna and I were at Caffe Siena together for restaurant week and we usually have very similar opinions on food/service so I apologize for any overlap.  The quick and dirty review - food was exceptional, service was mediocre and the environment was uncomfortably warm and lackluster (though not terrible).  As my appetizer I ordered the baked eggplant - and wow - I almost wish I could have ordered it for dinner.  It was a generous portion stuffed with fresh mozzarella and a light tomato sauce.  I honestly thought nothing would outshine this starter but the sea bass was a flaky, tender and flavorful delight.  It was topped with thinly sliced vegetables and sat on a bed of potato gratin topped with a most delicious lobster sauce.  For dessert I tried to be \\\"good\\\" and ordered the mango-berry sorbet.  I did indeed get sorbet. And it did indeed taste like mango-berry.  Not much more I can say on that.  \\n\\nAs for the service, our waiter was very sweet but the timing of our experience was not very good.  Our reservation was for 8 PM and we didn't leave the restaurant until nearly 10 PM.  We also sat with finished entree plates for a notable length of time.  \\n\\nPerhaps my biggest complaint was the temperature.  If you have not been to Caffe Siena before, the kitchen is viewable from the restaurant.  It's a large cut-out in the wall and the prepared food is actually placed on a visible counter for the servers to pick up.  Now anytime you decide to combine the kitchen and the dining room it's super important that the heat coming off the kitchen is tempered by a solid A/C system.  I'm not sure what was going on but the front door of the restaurant was propped open, the ovens were going full force and by the end of dinner some of us were sweating. The smell that came out of the kitchen also permeated into the dining room so it smelled like I was standing over the frying pan for most of the night.  My clothes also smelled after leaving. If you've ever worked for a restaurant before, you'll know what I'm talking about!\\n\\nIf Caffe Siena could match their ambiance and service to their food, I'd be a recurring customer - no doubt."}

I had my daughter at Top of the Classs for about a month and a half before pulling her out due to rude staff and the poor quality education she was receiving. I am absolutely shocked that this place is in business. I can concur with another Yelper about the front doors constantly being left open which is extremely concerning. On top of the lack of security, I'm not sure any of the teachers have any formal education or teaching credentials. Miss Melanie the supervisor/manager is extremely brusk and rude. If she was working the front desk she would NEVER greet my daughter or me at drop offs or pickups. She would make eye contact and look back down at her phone or paperwork. The center is outdated and I witnessed large groups of children eating snacks and lunches on the floor in the hallway. There were older children (8-10 year old's) running around the younger pre-k children completely unsupervised. My daughter learned some EXTREMELY inappropriate things and constantly complained about older kids picking  on her and calling her names. My daughter is well adjusted and has never had issues. I made a huge mistake by ever introducing this school into her life. \\n\\nThere are some wonderful primary schools and preschools in the Valley. Unfortunately, Top of the Class isn't one of them.

They end up taking you inside the room for more details, but the privacy is a bit sketchy in my book.\\n\\ne.  Charges - We are under 60 but got the shingle vaccine.  Cost is over 200.00 per person. This is standard as insurances will cover you after 60, but before it is on you.  I accept this but the system they have and how you check in does not let you know this in detail.  And, what is worse, the clinics billing is poor. I paid all my fees on Amex and still getting a bill to pay the fees from their central billing department. This bill is poorly done, not too much information and on the back there is no data on what to do if you dispute or anything like terms or conditions. \\n\\nI will come back again, as it is cheaper than urgent care, but this place is not too inviting as the experience is kind of blah."}

No craft beer on tap, and a couple of generic craft beers in the bottle. \\n\\nI can't imagine it would take much to get a variety of real craft beer ... several IPAs, some witbiers/hefe selections, and perhaps some stouts and porters. It would be an easy way to attract the beer aficionados with the money and interest to come in and have some quality beer. The food is GREAT, it's just that the beer selection SUCKS. Probably the last time I come into this place ... bummer."}

I was excited by the patronage and despite the crowd, we were seated in minutes. Our waitress was super attentive and our table faced the kitchen. I steadily observed the kitchen staff, dirty plates on the ground and snacking off the food. One person on staff drank a beer, latte and red bull while preparing meals. I had the octopus salad, black cod and a dozen oysters. I was pleased with the octopus salad but disappointed in the black cod. At $40 and with such a flowery menu description, I was ready to be wowed. Unfortunately, perhaps due to a distracted staff, Ferriera just did not deliver on two basics---salt and pepper. It was aesthetically pleasing but very bland. One of my friends had a bone in his fillet and my other guest got the $51 mixed seafood plate with both missing and more bland seafood. \\n\\nBetween elements of bland and incomplete plates, I was underwhelmed. The service was great but I'll never eat there again."}

{"_id": 1, "text": "The key word for Fuzzy's is bland. This is some of the most taste-free food I've ever had. Earlier this year I purchased a Groupon worth $10, and on my way home from Art Fair on the Square I decided to stop in. \\n\\nFuzzy's is inexpensive, so I ordered the taco plate (2 soft shell - chicken and shredded beef, with Mexican rice and fried potatoes for the sides), chips & queso, and a soda to bump me up past the $10 mark. \\n\\nThe signature of Fuzzy's is their unorthodox toppings - in addition to your standard lettuce/tomato/guac/etc, they include feta cheese and garlic sauce. At least they claim to, anyway. On my tacos there was maybe three little crumbles of feta (which in combination with the other cheese is enough, but not really enough to add any flavor), and I didn't taste any garlic at all. \\n\\nThe tacos are heaping and meat-heavy, but again - little flavor. I probably could have closed my eyes and not been sure which taco had chicken and which had beef. The rice was okay, and probably the most flavorful thing overall. The fried potatoes had a slightly undercooked generic potato flavor. The chips and queso is ridiculously large - for $3 you get five or six servings of chips and somewhere around 1-1.5 cups of melted cheese. This would be an awesome deal if the queso wasn't so blah. \\n\\nFuzzy's seems to be going for some sort of Tex-Mex/Mexicali hybrid, and for me it just doesn't work. What little flavor the dishes did have was not a flavor profile I enjoyed. I had hope for Fuzzy's being that it was a Texas chain -  while living in Texas I had plenty of cheap, chain Mexican food that wasn't great but was miles above Taco Bell. I was hoping Fuzzy's would be in the same category, but the only part that reminds me of the food I enjoyed down south was the fact they had Dr. Pepper and Fanta on tap."}

{"_id": 2, "text": "I graduated from PVHS in 1976, the Bicentennial year! Moved to Phoenix (and into PVHS) near the end of my sophomore year, 1974. By comparison, the high school I left (in Wisconsin) and the school I came to (PV) were opposite ends of a coin.\\n\\n1. There aren't any cowboys in Wisconsin. In contrast, I got to describing PV as \\\"6,000 cowboys and the Drama Club.\\\" And I wasn't far off. \\n2. None of the required reading in my high school in Wisconsin (Slaughterhouse 5 by Vonnegut and Siddhartha by Hesse, for example) we even AVAILABLE in the PV library. I remember asking about those titles and the librarian called them \\\"smut\\\" and seemed offended that I would ask. (If found out that if you wanted to read those books you had to take classes from Mrs. Alderman, who was the best English teacher EVER. She just passed in 2011 at age 97. )\\n3. The quality of education in Wisconsin, on a scale of 1-10, was 12. Here, they were happy to teach at a level of about 6. \\n4. Smoking at both high schools was not allowed but people did it anyway. Smokeless tobacco though? In Wisconsin nobody'd even HEARD of it. Out here, it was Cowboy Candy! Guys were spittin' that shit all over campus.\\n5. You could bring a knife to school and wear it on your belt and nobody cared. In Wisconsin, nobody even thought about doing that.\\n6. By coming to PV I managed to get through high school without ever writing a \\\"term paper,\\\" because none of my teachers ever asked for them. In Wisconsin I couldn't have avoided it.\\n7. The study hall was a great advancement out here, compared to the cafeteria used in Wisconsin. PV's study hall was a separate building with a very small room you could actually study in. The rest of the building was filled with air hockey machines, pool tables, a snack bar and a stereo playing whatever albums kids brought in to play. \\n8. I will say that the English department down here had it all over my Wisconsin HS, because you could take classes based on types of literature. I took Science Fiction, Humor in Literature and other interesting classes.\\n9. In Wisconsin,the drinking age was 18, which means seniors and teachers frequently socialized at the same bars. This led to odd situations, to be sure, but nobody went to jail for it. In AZ at that time drinking age was 19. That didn't keep the occasional teacher and student from commingling, but nobody cared. It was a different time."}

The tables can all be moved and put together and it looks like a common occurrence. \\n\\nI'd heard the tuna melt was good so that's what I went.  It was fine.  If you're expecting a grease-laden tuna monstrosity, you'll be sorely disappointed.  It was probably more like a tuna sandwich you might make at home.  The bread was a nicely toasted whole wheat, probably a smallish scoop of tuna, a swipe of mayo, some nicely melted jack cheese and a slice of tomato.  The tuna wasn't cold so it must have been heated up but it seemed more like it had gone through one of those giant toaster contraptions they have at Quizno's.  The Ruffles-like chips were a bit better than Ruffles out of the bag but not by much.  My friend had the same so can't really add more about his meal.  \\n\\nOther people's food looked good.  The staff was nice and patient.  There was a TV tuned to sports with the sound off. The salad bar looked great: extensive and lots of fresh produce (at least it looked fresh)!  They have a lot of soups on the menu.   It looks like they have mostly Coke-products (I'm a Coke-girl) at the self-serve soda area though they had some specialty waters and sodas near the register. \\n\\nI'd meet a friend or a group of friends there for a healthy-tasting sandwich."}

We walked in and we took a peak at the menu. Everyone was satisfied with the selection so we asked to be seated. I got the chicken salad croissant sandwich which came with a side. I opted for a mixed greens salad with balsamic. The sandwich was excellent! The side salad was good, a simple mixed green salad with fresh ingredients. No complaints.

I walked up and saw the posted hours-- 4:30pm close, and my watch was just about at 4:30. I reached to open the door, unsure if it would be locked-- to my pleasant surprise, it was still open, I was so excited. The cashiers allowed me to head back to the warehouse-- again, I was relieved! I made a beeline for the toys and just a few feet before I reached them one of the workers pops out, literally stands in the middle of the aisle with his arms crossed (as if I were trying get backstage at a concert), and tells me the business is closed and that I had to leave. I told him that I just needed to grab a couple of toys, that I would need 2 minutes (under the circumstances, I would have been quick), but he wouldn't let me pass. When I politely persisted he asked me what toys I was interested in, and told me he would get them for me. I told him that I couldn't possibly know what they had in stock and that I just needed to visually see what they had (and how the heck do you describe some of these dog toys anyway??). No dice, he told me that I had to go. Really?? \\n\\nInflexible, embarrassing, and a total wasted trip. I was steamed. Rather than ask for a manager when I was agitated, I decided to drive home and email customer service. They emailed back the following Monday and told me, essentially, the employee did was he was supposed to do, blaming it on concern for customer safety with all of the heavy equipment they utilize after hours in the warehouse. Mind you that I had been let in building, that nobody stopped me from entering the warehouse, that it had maybe just turned 4:30, that there were other customers there, that there was no heavy equipment in sight and that I had asked for 2 minutes. They were perfectly fine with their employee telling me that I had to leave, and they made no effort to keep a repeat customer.\\n\\nBummer, I was so excited to learn of Ryan's Pet Supplies a couple of years ago-- and indeed, they have a great selection at terrific prices, I considered it worth the burden of driving into a bad area with restricted hours.

The waitress was friendly, and recommended a few items from the menu. I ordered her #1 choice of a fried bologna sandwich with french fries. The sandwich was completely saturated in grease. It's a grilled sandwich so I expected it to have some grease, but this was absurd. I ate about three bites. My boyfriend ordered fish and chips and it, too was covered in so much grease it was not edible. Needless to say we paid a hefty price for heartburn and stomach aches for the rest of the day. We will not be returning. If I had to recommend one thing, it would be to save your money and eat at the deli in Harrah's."}

{"_id": 1, "text": "The BF did some research on Cajun/Creole restaurants in Vegas before we headed there again for the second time this month. I was a bit skeptical when he asked me what I thought about trying the Rhythm Kitchen - probably because there were only 2 Yelp reviews and neither of gave me warm fuzzies about the food. Since Creole/Cajun food is the BF's favorite and we're always looking for new restaurants to try, we thought we would give the place a try. On 7/24, we took a drive down Decatur to the Rhythm Kitchen for lunch. The restaurant is a wonderful modern establishment that unfortunately sits all by itself in a deserted area. When we arrived at the restaurant my first instinct was to turn around and leave. The parking lot was pretty empty and it seemed like a ghost town. That coupled with the fact that the place had somewhat of a foul odor. I should have followed my instinct and left. For starters, they give you a lunch menu, but beware because most if not all the prices are exactly the same as those on the dinner menu. And you pay dinner prices for lunch size portions. Are you kidding me! Here's the scoop on what the BF and I ordered: \\n\\nJambalaya - Spicy but lacked that authentic Cajun seasoning and flavor. It was also a bit too soupy. Not bad, but I've had much better. \\n\\nShrimp and Catfish Po Boy - Large pieces of shrimp and cornmeal battered fish. Just ok. Again, it seemed to be lacking something. A bit bland for my taste. \\n\\nRed Beans and Rice - Disgusting. Truthfully, the Popeyes Chicken across the street tastes much better. \\n\\nCajun Rice - Not sure why they opted to switch the andouille sausage for spicy sausage (as indicated by the waiter), but I didn't care for this side dish. Like the red beans and rice, the Cajun rice had zero flavor. \\n\\nSweet Tea - I was really excited to see that they offered this southern delicacy. However, I was very disappointed. How can you serve \\\"sweet tea\\\" when the tea is not sweet??? \\n\\nOn the upside, they serve you delicious hush puppies with honey butter and they will keep them coming. Just be sure to finish up before 3:00 PM because they will hover over you and attempt to rush you out so they can close up shop early. Bad customer service, especially for a new establishment. Overall, however, I would not recommend this place. There are better places both on and off the strip."}

I wouldn't mind giving green tea and hazelnut a go but not this time. I got the eclaire (chocolate dipped original) a coco and a cookie with vanilla filling. Lets start with the cookie. It  had bits of cookie all over the pastry and the cookie bit tasted good. it wasn't filled all the way and had almost 50% air inside the puff pastry and was a little let down. I read sok reviews that said it was filled with alot of filling so I was expecting the same. With that said all of the three cream puffs I got was filled the same and to me was not filled enough. the vanilla cream had a very light taste but it had a good consistency and good texture. the puff itself was made well and held the filling as it should. we then had the eclaire. it was go was go the chocolate added what seemed as a missing flavor if it had any and was a nice semisweet and not so much sugar it hurts your teeth chocolate. Then the coco puff. it was a coco puff with vanilla filling and I am glad I saved that one for last as it was the best one. the coco puff had great chcocolate flag and with the vanilla filling was a good combo. The workers were nice and greeted us and was very easy to talk to. Overall it is an ok cream puff, if I am in the area I would stop in to see if they have anymore flavors for the day besides vanilla but I dont think I'll be making a special trip just for these anything soon, unless they bring the sweet potatoes one here then ill be back lol!"}

Shoe stores and clothing stores are a dime a dozen - especially in las vegas."}

The only downside of the tour was the time spent inside the canyon.   With all the awesome sights an additional 30 minutes would have been ideal.  It was difficult to go everywhere we wanted in the limited amount of time we had.  Other than that, I would say this is one great tour for anyone that would like to take a helicopter from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon."}

They also have specials each night of the week so check them out! They have nights with half off apps, half off wine, etc. It's a great place to go and hang out, chat and catch up with friends. The staff seem knowledgeable and always willing to help! \\n\\n I've had some of the appetizers, the Mezza plate (olives/hummus/feta dip) and the Caprese salad.

They put the three bottles in front of me, but before I paid them, someone stole a bottle and ran off (a fair example of the client\\u00e8le City Nightclub draws). The bar staff said that I had to pay for all three and called over a bouncer to make sure I did or I would be thrown out.\\nDespite the club being pretty big, especially for Edinburgh, there isn't enough areas in the club to sit down and actually chat with you mates, which is probably deliberate as this makes you more likely to go for one of their drink 'deals'.

Long lines to get in and plenty of choices to choose from when getting to the seafood choices.  This time, no line to get in at 7pm on a Saturday night!  \\n\\nOne thing I love is getting a butter shrimped scampi or cleaned peeled shrimp with cocktail sauce. What did I see?  Cleaned but unpeeled shrimp!  Come on!  I'm on vacation!  You want me to peel shrimp?  \\n\\nHaving been here a couple of times, I had noticed that the \\\"seafood\\\" in seafood buffet has dwindled a bit.  When I took a look at what they offered, I can see that maybe 55-60% of the buffet was seafood with the remaining part offering meat or other cuisines that offered meat dishes or seafood dishes.  The shrimp dumpling that they had wasn't so great...I've had better.Their baja included fajitas and things didn't impress me.  However their pork spareribs were unexpectedly awesome.\\n\\nThere are so many ways to prepare seafood dishes.  For example, I'd love to see if they could had made something inspired from the South or maybe something done Asian style like with miso.  Instead we got a couple of baked seafood items and the usual array of deep fried calamari, clam strips, and shrimps.\\n\\nI made sure to not forget about dessert.  The gelato selection that they have over there is excellent!  I had the blueberry cheesecake gelato and it rocked my world.  They also had the Elvis, peanut butter/jelly/banana!  No thanks...I'm not ready to channel Elvis after a full meal like that.\\n\\nFor $48, I hoped to have the same experience as before.  They really need to change things up a bit.  During my meal, I was having one of those cravings for a Red Lobster like cheesy biscuit.  When you're thinking of Red Lobster while at a Vegas seafood buffet, then you know something is amiss here.  \\n\\nI'd definitely come back if they looked into making their seafood buffet more focused to what they advertise."}

Once we got a servers attention and got the table cleared and our drinks and food ordered the server forgot our drinks and when we where finally able to flag her down our food came out not even 5 minutes later.

I hadn't been to this particular restaurant in 25 years so I was pleased to see that it was doing well.\\n\\nWe arrived just before the dinner rush, so we were seated immediately.  The service was excellent.  Our water and iced tea were kept full and the warm bread was replenished.\\n\\nI had the fish and chips.  My husband had the salmon.  My son had the seafood platter.  \\n\\nMy husband felt his portion was too small, the fish was overcooked, and the pilaf was too salty.  He felt we paid too much for what we got.  He was also unimpressed with the beer selection.  He prefers brew pubs.  At Red Lobster he drank iced tea.\\n\\nMy son, who is 11, gobbled up his food and exclaimed over how good it was.  But he's a kid, and he tends to have different tastes.\\n\\nI felt my fish and chips were perfect and while it was expensive, it was competitive with other restaurants.  It's always pricey to eat out, and if you want seafood you have to pay for it.  If I want to run out to a family restaurant for fish and chips and a glass of iced tea, this place is fine.  My husband says he is still looking for the right seafood restaurant."}

{"_id": 1, "text": "My family (wife, kids, and parents) and I have never been to P F Chang's and decided to try it out since most of our friends like it.  We really like Chinese food in San Francisco CA, but I decided to come without super high expectations.\\n\\nWhy the 2 stars?  It's a combination of reasons.  Even though I did not walk in with super high expectations there is still a certain par level for a restaurant that prices Chinese food that high and claims to \\\"create great, crave-able Chinese food that guests cannot get anywhere else.\\\"  What a claim!  So I guess you can say that I did have a level of expectation based on their own claim.  \\n\\nI ordered the shrimp with candied walnuts lunch plate with fried rice.   The flavor was really nothing extraordinary, it was rather bland.  The sauce was tangy and the melons sweet but the shrimp had no savor.  The shrimp was also chewy.  The fried rice was, how do you put it, fried rice.  The hot and sour soup, on the other hand, had great flavor.  It had just the right amount of sour and spiciness to it. \\n\\nThe rest of my family didn't have anything wonderful to say about their lunch dishes.  My wife had the Chang's spice chicken and my parents shared the wonton soup and Chang's chicken lettuce wraps.  The kids didn't complain about their dishes and they rarely rave about food anyways, so their reactions did not contribute to the rating in this review.  However the kids' food, and sauce that came with it, came out piping hot (it was too hot to handle with even our fingers).  My wife and I had to blow on their food for several minutes so that the temperature was palatable to their young sensitive mouths.  Mind you that we understand that food comes out hot at every restaurant but this time it seemed like the food was taken straight out of the fryer and sent directly to our kids. This event DID contribute to the rating in this review.  \\n\\nThe service was ok... nothing great and nothing bad.\\n\\nIn conclusion, PF Chang's China Bistro did not create great, crave-able Chinese food that guests cannot get anywhere else.  They certainly did not create it with my shrimp dish nor the dishes that the rest of my family had.  This experience certainly does not scream \\\"lets go there again!\\\"  I often have a craving for Chinese food from a few other smaller restaurants in Henderson.  On top of that, they are inexpensive compared to PF Chang's.  We will not be coming back."}

Hottest chicks, all nude, best overall value compared to other Strip clubs in Vegas which are topless only and super expensive. Went on a Tuesday, and it was awesome, plenty of girls, good atmosphere. They say the lap dances are two for one on Tuesday but it seems all the strippers had their own price, some say $20 for a lap dance others $40. Either way, great experience, fine girls for sure. Will go again next time I'm in Vegas. The only complaint is the cover which is $30 for visitors, and if you get money out of the ATM there it's a $10 fee which is insane so bring plenty of cash."}
{"_id": 2, "text": "If it were only about the sushi, Nobu would get 5 stars from me. But, I knock off 2 stars for service. We walked in on a Saturday night and got seats at the sushi bar, which is the place to be. We went with our sushi chef's suggestions, which were Nobu's house specialties, including \\\"new-style sashimi.\\\" These consist of the best fish, sashimi style, with delicate sauces and garnishes: yellowtail with jalapeno, live octopus with a Peruvian chili paste, whitefish and salmon with ponzu sauce, tuna with miso-mustard sauce. Everything was first-class, including the Junmai Daiginjo sake.\\n\\nThen, I ordered the bento box chocolate cake dessert. We were told it would take 8 minutes to cook. No problem - our bellies were happily full of sashimi. 20 minutes later, however, still no dessert, and we finally were able to flag someone down to check on it. Another ten minutes went by. Our waiter then came out to tell us there was a mixup in the kitchen and our cake went to another table. He tried to give us a plateful of mochi ice cream to tide us over - this didn't go over well, as the last thing we wanted was to eat a plateful of mochi ice cream and then a chocolate cake. Another ten minutes or so, the dessert came out. It was excellent, but frankly wasn't worth waiting over half an hour for. We ask ed for the check while still eating...took another ten minutes...gave the credit card and another ten minutes went by...waiter came out to tell us the credit card isn't clearing and do we want to give another card? By this point, well over an hour had gone by since dessert was ordered and we just wanted to leave already. \\n\\nWhen our check finally arrived, they did charge us for the dessert that took over 30 minutes to arrive at our table. When I mentioned this to the server, he took it right off the bill. But I was miffed that I even had to ask - the right thing to do would have been to take it off in the first place.\\n\\nToo bad, since up until we ordered dessert we were very pleased with the sushi our wonderful chef served us. Even for a Saturday night in Vegas, the service was unacceptably unresponsive for such a high-end restaurant."}

That's quick service! \\n\\nAlso, the wedding packages are definitely very very very affordable! I was on a budget since I was paying for most of the wedding myself. Kristen definitely helped us with our budget and made sure everything we wanted was set perfectly. The food at the venue was amazing. The chef was very accommodating when we were trying out the foods and asking about food allergies. Yes, there is gluten free items available! And the cake company they work with (Cravin Cakes) is amazing. \\n\\nFast forward to the day before our wedding. Rehearsal was smooth and they sent email reminders and phone messages to remind us the time and if there were changes. Day of the wedding. Service is great. Everyone made sure we were okay and everything was going well. One complaint I did have was the cake serving. The cake slices were like slivers... almost nonexistent. And some of my guests didn't get served cake because they weren't at their seat. We addressed it to Kristin after the wedding by email and she emailed back and apologized. \\n\\nOverall, I am very impressed with Canyon Gate as a venue. I do recommend working with Kristin!

We were disappointed that the one Italian restaurant we wanted to eat at here (and the main reason we stayed here this time) was closed for Thanksgiving week. Something to remember for future reservations - always check on the restaurants or stores that you want to visit first to see if they're open or still there...  Check-in and out was a breeze (the staff are extra nice). The only room complaint we have is that the water pipes in our room were extremely noisy all night (coming from other rooms as well!) and this was very disturbing and difficult.  Too bad, seems like the glitz is a facade for cutting corners on construction. Too bad.  We did like that the hotel has free and easy parking, although they get you with a high resort fee on top of the room rate (most Marriott Hotels do this - NOT NICE MARRIOTT!). But, at least this place didn't charge for parking too... The little coffee bar near reception is horrible and unhappy not nice people work there - and their coffee is nasty... the lady never acknowledged me and never said thank you or you're welcome even after I said it three times!

Unfortunately, it was 100\\u00b0 plus every day while we were there, so we kept mostly to the indoors.\\n\\nWe stayed in the spa room on the 29th floor which was pretty nice.   The spa was a wide enough to have two people lay side by side with plenty of room still, and the view from there overlooked the strip for the best view I've ever had there.   Shower had a space between the glass door and glass wall so water was always squeezing between the two and wet the floor, so we had to have a couple towels there all the time. It had a steamer control but it's a wise idea to keep your feet far away from the tube that pours that out, as it's HOT!  Room safe faces you as you sit on the toilet and wasn't big enough for a laptop so that did us no good.  TV was an older tube with the volume blown, but who really comes to Las Vegas to watch TV?  \\n\\nBed had no comforter on it, but with controls for maintaining the room temperature, I guess it wasn't really needed.  We did get chocolate left on the pillow on the day we called for new linen from housekeeping which was cool.  And we got the wired internet (that's right, wired!) and two small bottles of water for the price of the resort fee which blows.  A copy of the USA today was available in the center of the hotel floor, but we kept waking up late and found the copies were always gone.  \\n\\nThe casino itself was somewhat on the quiet side, but like every other casino I've seen there lately, they had booty girls doing their dancing from 3pm until ?pm/am.  I have to say also that this was one of the best smelling casinos except for the front of the Lance Burton Theatre, where it always seemed to have a strong fart smell.\\n\\nSlots were very tight and unforgiving and the waitresses seemed few and far between - you could get super thirsty waiting for any to pass by.\\n\\nThis I guess replaces a review I had here before but has mysteriously vanished."}

The wine list is pretty impressive and not horribly priced. The had live music playing in the lounge which was really good. I was very surpised at the quality of the music. If I were braver I would have gotten up and danced. \\n\\nEventually we were lead back to back to the main dining room and I was floored by the view. Very nice! We were seated by the window facing west which I had read ahead of time was the place to be for the best view. The reviews were right, it was beautiful. If i were just here for drinks and the view I would definitely be giving this a five star review. Unfortunatelly the rest of the experience was less than impressive. \\n\\nWhen our waitress came over we asked her what she recommended for appetizers, of course she recommended the $80 oyester and clam plate. Her next recommendation were the two next most expensive items on the menu paired together. Really? I hate it when you can tell a server is trying to up their payout. Maybe she really did like those items, but she could have at lease sold them better. Her attitude was very cold and felt like she had much better places to be than waiting on us. We did get one of her recommendations, the anitpasto platter. It was good but i've had better. No one at my table seemed to like it besides me. Since it was a Spanish themed tapas platter, I think the ingredients were a little to exotic for the small town midwesterners I was eating with. \\n\\nWe then ordered our dinner. I had the strip steak with the farro corn pesto salad. It was very good. Very well cooked and the flavors of the salad worked really well with each other. When I asked my dining companions if they enjoyed their meals, they all seemed to think their food was good, but i think when you see the caliber of the restaurant you just expect more. Something to wow you. We were never wowed. \\n\\nI've seen other people mention this and they're right, if you're eating a 3 course meal expect about a 3 hour dining experience. I'm not saying this is bad, it's actually nice to sit amd just enjoy the views all night. \\n\\nFrom what I saw there's only one bathroom for both men and women. For a fairly large restaurant, this is surprising.  having to wait for a restroom after spending so much on a meal seems ridiculous. While waiting for the women's to open I saw a man and women walk out of one together.

My nachos were kinda good but mostly upsetting. The steak was like steak umms (TM) sandwich meat, the cheese was obviously from a can and was just heated up instead of being shredded or fresh cheese, and there was more jalapenos than steak, chips, and cheese.

I posted a screen shot of their FB post and I think it sums up the exact issues we had with their service. Very rude* \\n\\nwe had a nice server so he is mostly excluded from this review. the rest of the experience was really disappointing and our whole party wished we would have left and gone somewhere else all because of how things started off. \\n\\nlet me just say this place was practically empty the whole time we were there. there were a few people but most tables were empty. it was a pretty early dinner reservation. \\n\\nwe originally only had 6 people confirmed for dinner the night of my birthday celebration but we had 4 more people confirm last minute. we called as soon as The Breadfruit opened to see about extending our reservation. They told us they would only accommodate groups of 6. \\n\\nthis was a huge pain bc it was an hour before our reservations and people were already on their way. we were able to convince them to reserve a 2nd table next to ours on the patio so we would all fit and be able to sit near each other. Only after they confirmed we'd be ordering alcohol in addition to our meals of course. \\n\\nupon arriving we realized we had the whole patio to ourselves and if we pushed the tables together we would all be able to fit comfortably together with room for another table on the patio should they have more diners. \\n\\nwe asked if we could push our tables together and they were very snotty telling us we were basically lucky that they even agreed to accommodate us to begin with and the set up they created was our only option. we should bow down and kiss their feet for taking us at all. \\n\\nlike seriously?! you can't make any exceptions?! it would be one thing for us to suck it up if it clearly wasn't possible but it was totally possible for us all to sit together without changing a dang thing to the outside set up. it doesn't change anything!!!  our group could have sat together for crying out loud. it was totally possible. so stubborn and rude. \\n\\nso that really set the mood for all of us. if we thought someplace nearby could accommodate a group of 10 last minute we would have pimp walked outta there. \\n\\nbut we endured it, tried to get past it for the sake of the meal and enjoyed all of their tasty drinks and the food was good. i loved their pina colada redux. the spring rolls were super boring flavor wise and left me thinking \\\"what the heck, yelpers?! why did so many people recommend this?\\\". my jerk chicken was tasty. \\n\\nabout 95% of our group smokes so after the meal they went to the back area to have a smoke(it sounded like they had a nice area just for this). the servers chased everyone down in the smoking area and tried handing them the bill while they were back there enjoying themselves making things really weird. \\n\\nwhile the majority of the group was in the back smoking area they served me a free birthday dessert which was awkward bc shouldn't you do that when the whole party is around? they knew most of my party was out back seeing as how they chased them down with the checks. i blew out the candle and the few of us sitting there tasted it. it was one of the grossest things ever so thankfully it was free. it was a really sweet gesture though (but just fyi...dont order the potato dessert pie or whatever its called. better known as barf pie. i totally understand why they give that one away for free. no one would pay for that. just saying). but still, really kind birthday gesture. *ok, after reading some other reviews you people are loving this sweet potato pie. i am officially convinced they served us a rotten piece on purpose*\\n\\nthey don't usually let people split the check (we noticed this printed at the bottom of the menu) but our nice server offered to let us... only he made us divide everything up for him. i mean, isn't that his job? i get that it isn't normally allowed but he offered and it would have been really nice for him to divide it up for us. plus the restaurant was not busy and we spent a lot of money on food and drinks. it's the least they could have done but they apparently hate accommodating customers or providing an enjoyable dining experience for larger groups. this behavior would be acceptable at applebees or something. ugh whatever we were just so ready to get the heck out of there bc we were so clearly not welcome.\\n\\ni def won't be back and i know most of my party will not be back based on this experience. \\n\\nthis place really is only good for super small, intimate settings. i wouldn't recommend going here with more than 4 people. they make it known that they don't really want you there if there are more than 4 of you anyway so be prepared to have a horrible time if you're with a group.\\n\\nAlso, you can't even order breadfruit at the breadfruit."}

Turns out I am part of the 2% of women who have this painful reoccurring condition that doesn't seem to have a root cause & isn't every truly \\\"cured\\\". The process of \\\"dealing\\\" with this is apparently the worst pain imaginable outside of childbirth I assume. \\nDr. Norton sees patients on his rounds and then comes into the office after that or in the middle of, so this could explain long wait times (just to let you know). He seemed a little distracted in speaking with me as he asked me all the questions that were on the paperwork in front of him that I had already filled out. Then he explains what is about to happen kind of coldly, even after I have indicated my discomfort with such a visit. He put me in a room for a minute and I prepared. He comes back and just as I thought I would get some local anesthetic to deaden the already horrific pain ... The procedure begins. By the time we are done and it's not complete at this time I'm balling my eyes out. I'm told to take some Motrin for the next visit which appears to repeat this visit. I'm terrified. \\nI called the office the next day to tell them that the homework I have been doing wasn't breaking any ground and to ask if they had extended my prescription. I had to leave a message with the front desk lady at 10am and no one returned my call to tell me anything. It's Friday and the next visit was set for Monday and I needed antibiotics to take until then. I had been prescribed some at the emergency room visit but they would run out on Saturday. Dr. Norton had indicated I would get more to get me through til Monday. This did not happen. No one called me back. No one put the prescription in and I was basically SOL. I felt a bit let down by all of this and decided not to show up for the appointment on Monday. Maybe that was rude of me to be a no-show but I did not have any faith in Dr. Norton or his staff to trust them to resolve this issue appropriately. Its been a couple of weeks now. The situation hasn't managed to heal itself and I found out that I somehow managed to break two ribs during the procedure from bearing down so hard to attempt to deal with the pain. \\nObviously this is just one story as compared to the many many clients he must see but it did not work out so well for me and maybe my experience will help others avoid the same situation."}

I was let down by the menu to begin with, since one of the best parts of Belgian fries is the sauces, but for the most part their selections are very ordinary: plain ketchup, BBQ, hot sauce, etc. Between my friends and I, we ordered burgers/sliders (which were just decent), fries, a number of different sauces so we'd have variety despite the options being quite ordinary, and were delivered a completely different selection of sauces than what we had ordered. I called Sliders to request that they deliver the correct sauces and they delivered a bag *with our order correctly handwritten on it* yet with another seemingly random collection of incorrect sauces inside! We gave up. The fries were bland and oily anyway and bore little resemblance to authentic Belgian fries I've eaten in the past.\\n\\nThe second time, I tried to give Sliders another chance by ordering a burger and a slider -- since the burger had been the only decent component of my meal the first time -- and it was awful. The bottom of the burger was not only sort of charred, but absurdly, horribly salty. I *love* salt but I found this barely edible. A burger this bad from a cheap burger place wouldn't be as disappointing, but this was $5 to start plus they charge you extra for cheese and some other toppings (including the jalapenos, which were not very good jalapenos -- all heat, no flavor). The slider was a little better but nothing special, and seemed more like a tiny burger than a proper slider anyway. Overall, too much money for really lousy food."}

It was cold, extremely dry, flavorless, the noodles were dried out like they were cooked yesterday. In their menu it states they \\\"only use the finest quality imported pasta\\\". BULL $HIT. If they did, they imported it cooked already. Now for the meatballs, low grade hamburger meat cooked in grease with absolutely, I mean absolutely no seasoning or flavoring and small, way to small for the price of them. The pizza was dry, crust was hard as a rock, cold and the pizza smelled & tasted like one of those frozen pizzas you get from the supermarket. The toppings besides the pepperoni was sparse, a light sprinkling of about a half a hand full for a 24\\\" pie. And guess what the soda that came with the meal was warm.

{"_id": 1, "text": "I chose this facility for my first pregnancy because I wanted to have a natural as possible delivery and I'd read the the midwives here were very supportive of that. Let me just say that every single visit I had to wait at least an hour to be seen, the ladies at the desk were rude lazy and all they did was talk badly of the midwives.  Once I waited almost 2 hours because they hasn't even checked me in and let my midwife know I was there for my appointment. There were 3 midwives that I loved, one of whom was new and actually ended up being the one at my delivery, the other 2 I absolutely hated. One told me she didn't care that I wanted to avoid drugs and intervention and told me there was no point in considering it. The other actually told me that she was offended I hadn't seen her regularly instead of another and was irritated by every question I had. The ultrasound tech didnt even ask if we wanted to know the gender she just blurted it out, thats fine because we wanted to know but for other families who choose not to i thought that was unprofessional and insensitive, she also always acted like she was upset and annoyed. The midwife I saw regularly was Kim and she was wonderful except for one thing. My delivery at Phoenix Baptist hospital was a nightmare, after the anesthesiologist screwed up my epidural TWICE I declined another and she literally pinned me and they forced yet another excruciating epidural on me. I don't know if that was her or the hospitals choice but it was extremely traumatic for me. Ultimately I was forced into a c-section. I think that if they changed the front desk staff and didn't force patients to deliver at Phoenix baptist hospital this practice would be a lot more successful and patients would be happier. Personally I will not choose them for my second pregnancy."}

Salsa was bland and tasted bad/old. The ground beef and shredded beef tacos were a light brown color... Never seen meat look that color. Taste was even worse than it looked bad and texture was huge chunks.. Beans and rice tasted like they were cooked in old fat and sitting for days. Do not waste any money in going here!!!"}

There is nothing soft around to absorb sound, so don't expect to have a conversation.  The music did tone down after a bit...but not because they lowered it.  Everyone who does talk has to raise his voice to be heard, so the sound escalates as the restaurant fills.  I had to put in the earplugs I always have with me.  My chicken pot pie used puff pastry underneath and on top of the filling.  The filling was okay; I didn't detect a lot of chicken in it, but it wasn't all sauce like some--mostly veggies I think.  The bottom crust couldn't be crispy, and the top crust wasn't either--so I just ate arouond the edges.  The chicken sandwich was ordinary, and the potato salad tasted more like the packaged salad in a regular market.  The one I make myself is much better.  It's unlikely we will return.

My sister and fiance are both servers and they were with me this day as well as a couple other friends. We were seated right away in an empty back section of the restaurant. I go to the bathroom and come back and my party is gone? Our table was moved because oops! No one's working that section of the restaurant. \\n\\nIt took over 20 minutes just to get our drink order taken. We had a couple people stop by and say, someone will be right with you, someone will be right with you. We finally had another server stop by and start to take our drink order. People who had arrived after us were getting their drinks and salads already. Since we'd been waiting forever at this point someone said can we just go ahead and order while we're at it? And started placing their order. By the time the waitress got around to the last person (my sister) she was very impatient. Since my sister had some questions about the menu she started asking some polite questions (What comes with this dish? Can I sub this for that?) The waitress literally said \\\"Could you please hurry up? I have other tables to wait on.\\\" My sister sat there with her mouth open, flabbergasted that someone would be that rude to her especially since we were getting crappy service already. \\n\\nBy the time the rude waitress (I think her name was Bobby?) finally got our order in and it came out (forever later, no refills on drinks) my order of 1/2 lb. hamburger was wrong and I got a hamburger steak? I think they just took it to the back and put a bun on it but I don't care, I was hungry. My fiance finally gets up to get a manager to explain the extremely lousy and rude service we received and we ended up getting the entire 5 meals comp'd. I don't think we saw our \\\"actual\\\" server the entire time we were there. The oddest thing about this whole thing is that the restaurant wasn't even busy. They had sections closed off. Our waitress had only 5 tables or so seated during the time we were there.  We ended up tipping the hostess a couple bucks because she was the only person who competently (not that there's much competition here) did her job. \\n\\nToo long, didn't read version: If you go to this Cracker Barrel make sure you get a good server and if it starts to take more than 10 minutes to get your drink order taken, you should consider leaving before you even start.

And admittedly I do love their Pear, Rocket and Walnut salad... and that's about the only plus I can muster I#m afraid.\\n\\nIt's hard not to compare Let Me Eat to Thyme, which occupied the space in its previous incarnation. The former is managed by one of the latter's old staff, so I think that alone gives me licence. And with this in mind, I can't help but think they've looked at what Thyme did and tried to emulate it at half the cost. Unfortunately it shows.\\n\\nRolls and Paninis aren't filled quite so generously as they once were, salads are smaller, soups less extravagant. The whole set up smacks of a bunch of first-timers trying to make more money by spending less. \\n\\nOn my last visit I had Chicken Noodle Soup, which was chicken stock (fair enough, I'm a fan of that) and about 4 noodles and... well, let's say I'm STILL looking for the chicken! Thyme used to offer thick broths and meaty beasts packed with flavour and ingredients (Red Thai Chicken, Meat Ball, Smokin' Chicken.... these are soups!); Let Me Eat offer think, stock-based half-efforts.\\n\\nOne morning I opted for toast, a bargain at 50p you would think. Only both the bread and butter had been frozen overnight, so the bread cooled very quickly, and the butter was simply a clumped into the centre of the bread and the lad sandwiched it all together in the hopes it would melt into the bread by the time I got to work. Alas, it did not. Woeful.\\n\\nIt's a shame, because the staff are very warm and friendly, and I'd like them to do well. But to succeed with this venture they're going to have to invest in better produce and deliver heartier portions. Otherwise they will inevitably follow the path of the superior Thyme. If they couldn't make it... these guys don't stand a chance."}

We chose to go early because who likes to be full of food when they go out later that night? Not me. \\n\\nThe food was pretty decent. I tried the truffled potatos, the shrimp miso, spinach salad, and a few other choice items. All in all, not that bad. I did like the fact that they were also plated separately, which made it easier and gave points for presentation. But, presentation doesn't make it for me entirely. Some of the stuff was also a bit overcooked. \\n\\nThe dessert were also a big draw for me to these types of things, I tried one of each and didn't really find anything that stood out as well. It was all packaged wonderfully though (once again, points for presentation) but to be honest, the only thing I really liked was the chocolate covered strawberries and the Chocolate mousse/berry thing they had. The gelato was 'meh' since it tasted like the typical gelato stuff. \\n\\nAll in all, not bad, but I probably wont be spending $37.50 + Tip for something like this again.

We proceeded to order Tom's classic cheeseburger, a pastrami burger, and an order of chili cheese fries. The cheeseburger and pastrami burger tasted like those found in Cali and were pretty good. However, I wasn't impressed at all with the chili cheese fries.  The chili was just average and was seasoned a bit too heavily with cumin. Plus, the French fries in the Cali spots are usually on the thicker side but Tom's uses thinner fries that get soggy much quicker....strike two against!! Lastly, Tom's is a bit on the pricey side for what you get. For the two burgers, chili cheese fries, and a large drink, we paid almost $18.  This is around what you would pay in Cali but the portions are much larger, so there is less value for the money with Tom's......strike three against!! \\n\\nIf you live close by and like So Cali style charbroiled ghetto burgers, then you may enjoy Tom's, but for me, it's just not worth the drive from the other side of town."}

No need to skimp on paper napkins... And third (which was the worst), they ran out of dumplings! We ordered pork & zucchini which came out right away however, she said they were still making the pork & cabbage. We thought it would be maybe a 15-20min wait... but we ended up sitting there for over an hour. If they were out, she could've told us at the very beginning so we could've chosen a different flavor or just skipped it totally. \\nThe four of us ended up cancelling the pork & cabbage ones since we had to leave. Very disappointing. Lucky for them, their dumplings reminded me of the ones my grandma use to make back at home. The skin is hand rolled and chewy just the way I like it. The dumpling is stuffed to the brim with porky goodness and the juices drip off the skin once you bite into it. Dip the dumpling into some vinegar and hot sauce and you have the perfect dumpling. We also ordered some of the apps such as the chicken wings (skip), popcorn chicken (good), and liang ban fen pi (noodles were too long, difficult to mix with the non-existent peanut sauce).

The waiter Jered added much to the overall dining experience, as he elaborately described the history/culture surrounding each dish and described the wine notes and rationale for each pairing. The wines were excellently paired with each dish and portions were reasonable. Courses came at a very leisure pace, which we enjoyed - dinner lasted 2 hours. Price of dinner was just under $400 for the two of us (tip not included)...yes, pricey but quite honestly, the best fine dining experience we've ever had, and for that, the dinner was well worth it! I wouldn't recommend this for the casual diner or even those looking for only a romantic setting, but for true foodies that love wine pairings at its finest, I definitely recommend B&B Ristorante!"}
{"_id": 4, "text": "Had a battery fail which had been put in in Minnesota at a Valvoline so I checked locally to see if it was still covered under warranty. I spoke to Tyler who looked my account up while I was on the phone and found that my battery was covered, but that Valvoline no longer stocked that battery. He assured me they could replace it with a different one, but it would have to be ordered in which would take a couple of days. No problem for me and saved me a couple of hundred dollars.  He later called me to let me know when it was in. I then met Tyler when I came in to have it replaced and get my oil changed. He was just as organized, personable and efficient as he'd been on the phone. There are a lot fewer Valvoline's in AZ than in MN, so it is so nice that one is somewhat conveniently located to me and supplies the same exceptional customer service and friendliness. Even more, the owner of the Valvoline called me himself, as a random customer service check, and was also exceptionally nice and caring.  It's been more than six months, but my experience as Valvoline remains the best customer service experience I have had in the 2.5 years I have been in Phoenix.  That one person, Tyler, took control of my issue and handled it flawlessly from beginning to end over the course of less than a week seems to be a rare thing in AZ (much more common in the Midwest - so I am still adjusting expectations) and I remain so impressed, that as a client, it was all handled with minimum effort, follow-up or inconvenience on my part, that I wanted to write this review in the hope you can have a great customer service experience as well!"}

The caprese was different with cherry tomatoes (not my fav), liquified mozzarella, pesto, bread, and oil & vinegar.....although different I thought it was still very good but my wife did not care for it.  We both ordered pizzas, I had the SOP (sausage, caramelized onion, & peppers) and this was a great pizza with lots of great flavor.

Or I had to call the couple of promoters I know for only specific clubs.  Typically I had to wait in long lines.  Since my wife and I were going to Vegas for Halloween I decided to prepare ahead of time.  I stumbled across the website on line and after reading others reviews I decided to give it a try. I signed up to go to Tryst (one of the pricier clubs) on the evening of Halloween and got an instant confirmation. Chris was very thorough and began to be in communication leading up to that evening.  I have to admit I was skeptical since it was one of the busiest Vegas club nights of the year.  However, Chris texted me the day of and told me I was on the guest list.  I told the bouncers that I was on the guest list and I was instantly moved to the front of the extremely long line.  After about ten min, a lady with a clipboard came up and gave us passes and a complimentary drink! We got in a couple of minutes after.  Club was packed and we had a great time!  Thanks Chris for your professionalism.  I still find it hard to believe that this really works! I recommend highly."}

Often I even find a lot of things that I didn't know I was looking for, due to their very expansive and ever changing selection. They are closed on Sundays, which can be inconvenient at times, but then I remind myself how awesome/rare it is to find a company that places their values over profit, and ultimately it makes me like them that much more.

Another plus was that the location was very close to my wedding venue. The entire process before the wedding: Planning out what the Bouquets would look like and picking out flowers was almost perfect. I planned months in advance due to living out of state. I had picked a particular flower that Joanie had suggested for the bouquets. About a month before the wedding Joanie calls me and tells me that one of the particular flowers would not be in season for my wedding. This was a flower she suggested. She knew the date the entire time. You would think that before suggesting something or confirming it with me she would have double checked the season of the flower. Then she proceeded to tell me that we wouldn't know for sure if she could have them until 10 days before the wedding. Well we could not get them and the flowers she suggested to take their place were not very stellar. I ended up settling with a replacement. The day of the wedding the flowers arrived. My bouquet was beautiful. The corsages I had ordered for my mother and mother in law were supposed to be Crem de la Crem roses. They were HIDEOUS and not roses at all, my step moms corsage was also hideous and not what it was supposed to be and it wasn't even a corsage it had a pin so she had to poke holes in her dress. I also did not receive and toss bouquet which I paid for. I was so upset. You pay hundred and hundreds and even thousands of dollars for wedding flowers and when its not what you paid for or you didn't get everything you paid for, well you feel cheated and ripped off. I do not recommend using AJ's or Joanie for your wedding flowers or flowers for any event."}

Seemed to be not so well known, and a cheaper night than spending on the whole meal.\\n\\nWhat can I say, the food was fantastic.  The Seared Ahi tuna was delicious with just the right amount of wasabi flavoring.  I ordered the salmon special on a cedar plank that was cooked and flavored absolutely right.  Even the steak was delicious according to some of my table-mates.\\n\\nWine list was generous (a bit pricey) but well complimenting the meals.  The serving staff was a touch slow, but it was nice not to feel rushed.\\n\\nTIP:  Try their pretzel bread rolls.  They're delicious!\\n\\nBIGGER TIP:  Not really sure about parking here, (I think there was valet service) but if you take a taxi there like we did, be prepared.  On a cold, snowy night we were waiting a good 45 minutes for a return taxi to the city.  Make sure to get your cab driver's number on the way over.  Give him an estimated time that you'll be done, and call him before dessert.  You'll save yourself a load of trouble. \\n\\nAbsolutely a place to take clients/business dinners.  A little pricey, but the food and atmosphere will definitely impress.  It's a little out of the way, but still only a 10 minute cab ride from the Convention Center"}

When I moved to LV I was excited to be able to shop here again.\\n\\nThis location is severely lacking. It's old and dirty, not particularly well stocked or well staffed, and the prices on non-sale items can be a bit ridiculous compared to other places in the city.\\n\\nWent by when I was on this side of town for a work training, around 8PM. Only one cashier available, Toni, who was openly griping about the job and the customers- TO HER CUSTOMERS. A bit ridiculous.\\n\\nI grabbed a sale ad when I walked in the door but quite a few items on sale weren't even in stock or were low- only one case of Albersons' brand water, only one case of their house brand 18-count eggs, etc. \\n\\nThe produce section is confusing, not well laid out, and inconvenient- I only spotted three plastic bag stations, and they were very spaced out, requiring me to go back and forth repeatedly across the entire area. Luckily I was the only person there.\\nBut then when I wanted to double check the weight of my veggies, I notice there is only one functional scale to be found. Heaven forbid this place ever have more than five shoppers at once, it would be incredibly irritating.\\n\\nSubtracting an additional star for the hella-gross rotisserie chicken and sides area, which was already broken down- the large pans with self-serve sides in them were scraped out and filled with water that looked and smelled old. No idea how early they must have broken that station down, but again- it was only 8PM when I went in.

We noticed right away too that she had 2 tiny little pieces of lobster in hers, but I had almost an entire small claw.  I was happy until I realized it was tough and rubbery.  I actually had to use a knife and fork to cut it into bite sized pieces.  My husband ordered the wedge salad as a starter and it was 80% white/yellow core.  Not what you would expect in a place as pricey as this.\\n\\nI ordered the fillet and it was cooked perfectly but it was not a great cut of meat.  Maybe I have high standards, but I think a $30+ fillet should be butter knife soft, but this one was kind of fibrous and hard to cut with a steak knife.  I didn't really care for the seasoning either, but that's a personal preference, not something I can count against the restaurant.  My husband's rib eye was really fatty but he loved his twice baked potato.  I had the corn gratin for my side and it was tasty but again, not my style.  \\n\\nOur server was efficient but pretty standoffish.  When we first sat down, we ordered a bottle of \\\"Emerel's Blend\\\" wine and he nicely suggested that we might want to try something else, but other than that, his interaction with us was a bit cold.  \\n\\nMaybe it was an off night, but I really expected more from a $400+ dinner."}

The restaurant sits in an open area of the Mandalay Bay, so expect a loud environment towards the front of the place.  Being that this is Hubert Keller's spot, expect to pay for the food you get, if you're on a budget, don't bother walking in here (nor any other restaurant in a big label casino in Las Vegas).  Regardless, I went with the ahi tuna tacos and the wagyu burger.  The tacos had some issues to me as the shell was thick and I just lost everything else inside.  The slice of ahi was thicker than I had thought, which was a nice surprise.  But unfortunately the overall taco was not that great.  There was a longer gap before the entrees came out, but it didn't stop me from really enjoying the wagyu burger.  The patty itself was delicious and cooked to a perfect medium.  You can really tell a good patty apart by the consistency of the meat and Fleur hit it right on.  The potatoes on the side were a nice complement.  Not sure if I'd come back here, but it was a nice dining experience.  Prices are a tad high for what they serve, but again, it's Hubert Keller's restaurant in one of Vegas' nicer hotels."}

We were given shrimp instead of chicken so they replaced it with the chicken. The waitress let us have the shrimp, but decided to not eat them since they seemed a little under cooked. Also when our sides to the fajitas were served we noted that the beans were cold, and had to flag down the waitress to heat them up. \\n\\nI will say that their pork was really good as well as their beef, their guacamole was tasty but could use more lime. \\n\\nThe ambiance was nice and the place was clean.

The amber-filtered lighting in the bar/counter area and booths/tables is a cozy contrast to the adjoining patio, which exudes with sunshine and a hanging decorative bulbs in the evening. I recommend the latter for a nice outdoorsy Fall meal and that you grab a table on a Friday Happy Hour as soon as you get there. I was told the patio could be really crowded and noisy when High School kids from nearby congregate after school.\\n\\nGreeters and waiters/waitresses were attentive and overall did a good service. Food is average to say the least; they get points for plate presentation but lacks a kick of Mexican flavors that i would normally find at Moreno's. Safe bet to order are the El Grande Fiesta which consists of flautas, chimis and cheese quesadillas, and the fajita quesadilla with chicken which i thought is a decent meal for a reasonable price. The house margarita is ok too but it is not unforgettable. We were there from 5-10 on a Friday and i was really pleased at the casual atmosphere on the patio.

Water was never served unless asked for.  Everyone's meal was just mediocre to bland and we all had different entrees.  Before dinner was over, the waiter brought our check.  When we stopped him and asked about having dessert and coffee, he apologized, took away the check and brought over dessert menus.  We had to point out to him that some of us were still eating our entree.  Again he apologized.

Good sushi in the UK and Edinburgh can be very, very good -- but it'll never be the same quality, and value for money, as in the Cali / Japan.

It's just how it goes here.\\n\\nSo with that in mind, Harajuku Kitchen is good sushi, that will satisfy your sushi-cravings in the Burgh, although it is pretty pricey and can leave a wee hole in your pocket without feeling overly full (as is often the way of sushi and value for money).\\n\\nThe sushi they do is lovely.

{"_id": 1, "text": "Throwing an amazing party is not easy, I give them that. Tao, similar to other popular hot spots Rain, Tryst, Prive and clubs of the like, are so overcrowded that it's hard to enjoy yourself. Tons of people get on the guestlist, and those who aren't usually have to wait in a long line. When you're working at the door, the last thing you want to do is turn people away or make them wait. Trust me, I know the feeling. \\n\\nWe had a group of 12, and it was really hard for us to stay together. Even though we were on the guestlist, only the girls got in for free. Guys had to pay a $20 cover. Had we planned things out so that we had table service, we would have gotten our own roped off VIP section. Instead, we took our chances and unfortunately were packed like sardines on the dance floor. We made the best of it, and I ended up having a great time dancing, even though I was bumpin' and grindin' with people on all sides. \\n\\nJessica and Nicole got separated from us, but I found them standing near the window trying to look for us. They had gotten themselves into the VIP section next to boxer Bernard Hopkins who was in town for the fight. They took me back there, and we hung out there for a while. When our guy friends found us there, they were denied entry. That's when we decided to leave. While the rest of the group stayed and checked out Tao Beach upstairs (which was just as chaotic), we decided to call it a night. \\n\\nAs we walked down to the restaurant, they had cleared the area out and there were hardly any people down there even though there was another DJ spinning there and the bar was less crowded. We probably could have gotten the rest of the group to come down and hang out with us there, but we were pretty much over the scene and took off. \\n\\nYou'll find a lot of hot women put on display throughout the club. Although they are gorgeous girls with hot bodies, it was a bit disturbing to see them sitting in rose petal filled bathtubs and getting massages. I think what made it degrading was that they didn't look happy to be there and be stared at. I guess it's their choice, right?"}

They used to have a larger variety and now they are lacking!  They don't even offer the Big F's favorite - the Macanese egg tart, which really puts a damper on things.

{"_id": 0, "text": "Have you ever really wanted to eat in a sit down restaurant, but all that was anywhere near your house was one lousy place that was always over crowded, and the food was always pretty terrible?  If you have been missing out on this experience then I invite you to check out the Hickory Tavern in Wesley Chapel.  \\n\\nTonight, my girlfriend just got back from a conference in Vegas, and I am in the middle of a semester in college whilst working full time.  We are both overworked and tired, and just wanted some decent food without having to cook.  Unfortunately, all there is around here in the way of an American style sit down restaurant is Hickory Tavern.  Although we have consistently been disappointed with the HT's, some are more tolerable than others.  \\n\\nThe service is always slow, the places are always too crowded, and the parking just sucks all day long.  This one takes home the prize for all of those categories, and also adds bad food to the list.  Tonight we all ordered burgers with different sides, and different sauces for them, but I guess the staff elected to go with fries all around, and no sauces at all, ordered or not.  I like getting burgers at places because they are generally a safe bet, because how the HELL do you screw up a burger?  \\n\\nYou might start out by putting it on a soggy bun, and pairing it with soggy fries.  We could have maybe dipped the burger or the fries in the honey mustard or mexi ranch we ordered with our meals, but I guess they were out.  The soggy fry thing shouldn't have been an issue at all for my girlfriend because she ordered chips with her burger, but, like I said, I guess they were out. \\n\\nI skipped the salad I ordered because the burger looked good, and I didn't want to wait, but looks can be deceiving with Hickory Tavern food.  All in all, I think that was our last attempt with HT.  We don't like eating pizza or Chinese every time we want local food, but that is all that is decent around here.  We will probably become loyal patrons of literally anything that moves into the shopping center besides HT.  If any of either the parking, service, crowd, or food quality are better then it is bound to be better than Hickory Tavern at Wesley Chapel.\\n\\nAs for the bar experience, I haven't had it at this place yet, but judging by the crowd, if you are more than a one drink an hour person, you may just want to go to a Chili's or somewhere else.  I am not saying they are all this bad, but yes, they are all pretty lousy as a whole, and the odds are that if there is any other restaurant you can go to nearby an HT, it will turn out better.  Unfortunately that isn't the case around my house, but hopefully you all have more options."}

{"_id": 1, "text": "Went there with a buddy to use a groupon I had purchased based on previous reviews.  Easy to find, but not a lot of parking.  Inside was okay, fairly typical BBQ style setup.  The cashier must have seen me looking at my phone, based on the the semi snide groupon remark....I ordered the pulled pork with two sides and a drink, my friend had the chicken with two sides and a drink.  All together we paid $27 or so, which was wayyyyy too much, considering the little amount of food we received.  It was okay, nothing to write home about; the portion to price ratio is what left a sour taste.  Don't know if that's because we didn't pay full price there, but that's their business decision.  I won't be going there again, not even with a 50% off groupon."}

The sushi station was filled in a lot of good looking items. Had a nice selection of both your traditional Chinese food and your American food as well. The crab legs are good a little soft but nice tasty and warm. The dessert section was also awesome had a good variety of all different types of desserts including fresh fruit. The wait staff there was terrific always attentive towards the customer and was able to clean the plates off in a timely manner.

{"_id": 1, "text": "Back in the day of the early 90s when the Mirage first opened its doors, it was definitely considered one of the best hotels/casinos on the strip! I remember going there the first year it opened and watching Siegfried and RoyBut over the past 2 decades it has definitely declined in its overall quality! \\n\\nFirst of all, the casino/hotel definitely needs to remodel all the game play tables! They seem pretty worn out and the lighting in the casino is surprisingly a little too dim for me! I prefer bright lighting when I'm gambling my money whether I am winning or losing!\\n\\nSecond of all, when I come to Vegas I expect to be spoiling myself because Vegas in itself is a vacation getaway and it doesn't come cheap! The rooms are at a pretty cheap price and sometimes I am even offered free stay, but the interior design of the rooms are pretty old and cheap. The walls are so thin that you can hear everything happening ANYWHERE near your room  (conversations, other peoples tv sets, other guests bathroom, drunk people at 3am) . The bedding is hard and scratchy. My biggest pet peeve about the rooms are the bathrooms. I seriously do not think they have remodeled them since the 90s! The toilet system is pretty terrible in which it flushes fast but the water tank loudly continues for 5 straight minutes.  \\n\\nI WARN YOU **DO NOT ORDER ROOM SERVICE UNLESS YOU'RE DRUNK TO THE POINT OF NOT BEING ABLE TO WALK** The room service is extremely overpriced (as is most room service meals in Vegas Hotels) but the quality of the food is definitely NOT WORTH THE PRICE you must pay! The restaurants and bars in the Mirage are not too great. \\n\\nThe last time we stayed here back in april of 2012 we were sadly sadly let down to the point where I know I will never be staying here again even if I do continue to get free stays. We decided to stay because I got a special discount of $39 a night even on a weekend. We arrived mid afternoon to the hotel and went straight to the front desk to check-in, after a 15-20 minute wait (which is usually normal in any vegas hotel)  we finally got to check in, I guess the girl checking us in was relatively new because she had to ask her co-worker for step by step instructions on how to check us in. After 10 minutes we finally got our keys and walked up to the room, guess what? She gave us the wrong keys! They weren't psyched to our room!! We had to go back down to the front desk and get keys that actually worked. After a 2 night stay upon check out I overlooked the bill and it looked fine but when I checked my credit card statement they charged us twice for the same bill which then led me to call the Mirage and my credit card company to get it sorted out. I'm sorry but I just don't think the prices are worth the customer service, bad room conditions, old decor, and worn out gambling areas."}

My girlfriend was still hungry so she ordered a side of potatoes.  She said they were okay, but I did not try them. I was too mad about this \\\"culinary crime\\\" that had been perpetrated on me.

Typical entree prices are about $12-14.\\n\\nHere's my advice to have a 5 star experience:  1) Get the crepes. I don't care if you want a sandwich, or a plain old eggs breakfast. Forget it. Get the crepes. Best savory crepes in Charlotte, hands down. I have had the chicken coq-au-vin special crepes and they were OMG.  I also had the shrimp and artichoke crepes with lemon creme and they were similarly amazing. As in \\\"I don't care if I gain 10 pounds from this one meal, I'm finishing every last bite\\\".  2) Go on a weekday or a late weekend lunch. Forget going on a nice sunny brunch.

The first time they were unable to delivery after I paid the extra 3.99 to have the package delivered the next day. the second time which happen today they're tracking information said \\\"out for delivery\\\" and now it says \\\"UNDELIVERABLE - OTHER REASONS\\\" followed by \\\"REDELIVER ON NEXT BUSINESS DAY\\\". \\n\\nThe delivery man couldn't even put a legitament reason why my package could not be delivered. I am sure he felt he was running late and decided he would just take care of it the next day. Also the guy that first started to delivery packages to me would never smile even if I smiled at home and said thank you after receiving the package and he would not even say you are welcome. He would just hand me my package with a face as if he hates his job turn around and drive away. OnTrac needs to do a better job at training their delivery men on customer service skills. \\n\\nOverall they do a good job at delivering but I can't give them no more than two stars because compared to UPS or FedEx they just are not as good."}

C'mon guys, we are talking about the same place off of Arrowood 485, past Walmart?\\n\\nHere are my experiences, wrapped into one:\\nThe first time I headed there after reading such positive reviews on Yelp back in 2010. I held back writing an ill review because I planned on giving it another try. At the time, I ordered a Red Curry with 4 level spiciness. As always, we were offered the complimentary soup and it was very delish. Light and just enough to make way for the main meal. When the entrees arrived, they were ill-timed. Mine came out waaaaay before my lunch buddy's, which sucked because I always wait to raise my fork. Anyway, it came out a while later and we commenced. The spiciness was right but the saltiness was horrible, just plain horrible. I didnt want to bother because we were crunched of time. I simply squeezed the slice of lemon that was hanging off my glass, and it sort of mellowed it out. I ended up eating only 60% of the curry, because the rice to curry ratio was off.....maybe because of the salt factor? Service was also like the dish----a bit salty :)\\n\\nSecond time I went with my brother who was visiting from college. We decided to try Siam again for lunch and arrived when it was a full house. This time I ordered Pad Thai. When my meal arrived, it was something completely different, no noodles in sight but some kiind of ground meat with some veggies and slices of jalapeno!! I had to wait forever to get the servers attention and when I finally did, he apologized and asked to replace it. Again, I didnt want to kill valuable time so I stuck to whatever it was. It was too spicy for my liking, but whatever. This time too, the service was blah  but I understand with a full house that this is expected.\\n\\nThe 3rd and last time I went with my little sister visiting from TX. I had full faith in my fellow yelpers, so we decided on Siam again. Bad idea!! I ordered the Massamun with no spiciness at all and sweet tea.  I get the right dish this time, but the tea was unsweetened. No problem, Ill just add some on the table.....I did sweeten it, with sugar packets from 'Bojangles'!!! No lie! I mean the packs of sugar bore the trademark name/design of the chicken fast food place!!  How weird, or how creepy? Did someone just walk into a Bojangles and jack all the sugar packs from the tables, Lol, whatever the case is, it still makes me roar with laughter!\\nAnyway, the Mussamun arrives and again, Im doomed with the saltiest plate! Why?? It always happens to me and its not just me, I made my sister try it  and she spit it out in disgust. The nice server apologized and asked to replace it, so I ordered a different item. The Yellow Curry, mild.  That was just very ok, nothing flavorful or memorable. All I tasted was basil and coconut milk.....not good.\\n\\nAll in all, I wont ever find myself there again. Bad service, too bold seasoned food and really no redemption for all these missteps."}

I remembered driving past it before, and that it was a place I had been wanting to try. Go me!\\n\\nWe went inside and were greeted and seated promptly by the hostess.  Hungry AND no wait? Win!  The deco is modern with a farm/barn feel.  Lots of wood finishes, open layout, large centrally-located bar, and of course, the obligatory pig (and rooster) paintings on the wall.  So far, so good.\\n\\nWe sat down and were greeted by our servers (one vet, one newbie).  Guess what?  It was happy hour, and we were provided with the appropriate menu.  The beautiful thing about their happy hour is that you can get a number of things for $5 each (their \\\"bites\\\" and \\\"small plates\\\").  Did I mention the full bar? Yep--$2 off wells and their \\\"Signature Sips.\\\"  Bring me the rum, savvy?\\n\\nWe started off with the truffle deviled eggs appetizer ($5).  How do you make deviled eggs better, you ask?

Fries.  From this day forward, I will evermore be disappointed with every french fry I eat that isn't a duck fat french fry.  Damn you, Salty Sow! You've ruined me!

My wife picked the Honey Rosemary Dipped Fried Chicken (with Cat Head Sweet Potato biscuit), and I chose the Spit-Roasted Pork Taco (with sweet onion slaw, pickled onions, smoked tomato salsa, and cilantro aioli) and the Beef Shoulder Taco (with fried egg, arugula, and feta).  Now, I preface this by saying I don't call myself the \\\"Taco Destroyer\\\" for nothing.  Ask my wife and friends...I have an unhealthy obsession with tacos.  These tacos were delicious.  I ate half of each and (begrudgingly) gave the rest to my wife.\\n\\nOMG thank the gods I did.  I've had chicken and biscuits.  I've had chicken and waffles.  I've never had this.  My mouth waters and my stomach grumbles just thinking of that blend of salty and sweet, soft biscuit and crunchy breading, juicy chicken..............................................Sorry! Drifted off there for a second fantasizing about it.  I can neither confirm nor deny if I squealed while eating it.  Is there such thing as tri-winning?  Did I mention it was only $5 for happy hour...and enough to share????\\n\\nNext stop, dessert.  I have to admit, there was a problem with dessert--that problem being we couldn't decide between the bananas foster (think bananas foster, dipped and deep fried in a monte cristo like breading, topped with powdered sugar, and served with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream) and chocolate cake dessert (topped with whipped cream, raspberry sauce, and strawberries).  How to solve the problem? Order both, naturally.  Hey, if you're gonna go, go all out.  Sound delicious?  Multiply it by 10.  Then you might be getting close.  Maybe.  \\n\\nNeedless to say, we pigged out, thanked and tipped our waiters, and waddled to the car.  Pig puns aside, I only have one regret about the Salty Sow--we lived in Phoenix for an entire year before finding it.  My heart weeps to think of all those times I \\\"settled\\\" for a 4- or 5-star reviewed restaurant when I could have been dining here instead."}

I ordered garlic tuna and salmon nigiri and a roll that had mozzarella cheese melted on it. I know cheese and fish is a big no no but I've been duped by odd flavors before and loved then so I gave it a try. Not good. Nigiri was sliced so damn thick, I had to take two bites and it was not fresh tasting to me which instantly turned me off. Rice had no flavor but the sauces were good. I tried mochi for desert and they both had a fishy taste to them. Done."}

It has a great view and its surprisingly quiet and secluded while being right above Indian School road. The wine and beer selection is impressive. I really like all of the local choices. \\nThe food however was underwhelming. I started with the fries which had rosemary and parmesan and a dipping sauce similar to a thousand island on the side. It was good, but not great. For our entrees we had the sausage and mushroom pizza, and the penne ragu. The pizza was tasty, it had caramelized onions three types of mushrooms and Italian sausage, the crust was just the way I like it not too crispy and not too soft, but definitely a fork and knife needed pizza. The ragu was interesting; it reminded me of everything that would be inside a shredded beef burrito but instead of a tortilla it's in a bowl with penne pasta underneath. It wasn't bad just unexpected. I wish we would have tried desert they all looked delicious, perhaps next time. \\nAll in all I think this is a great place for appetizers and drinks especially on their wonderful patio."}

At first glance the menu is expensive: $2.50 for a small cupcake and $5 lavender soda. However, it's about the same price as a beer at the Blind Pig, and unlike with the beer, I can go to work after eating the cupcake.\\n\\n The beautifully decorated cupcakes I tried (green tea and salted caramel) were good, but not quite fantastic. I suspect they are still tweaking their recipe. The soda I tried was more like sparkling water with a hint of lavender, so it didn't really satisfy my craving for that flowery taste and I don't think it was worth $5. My friends did get tea though, which came in a beautiful clear teapot with a votive underneath that illuminated the table. \\n\\nI noticed that it's open late, so it might be a good late night snack for after you hit up the nearby hipster bars."}

{"_id": 0, "text": "Worst birthday experience of my life. \\nThere were eight of us who came from the resort pool to the patio for Aloha Hour, then dinner. First we were told that the patio was closed (on what had to have been the most gorgeous evening of the summer.) That's fine. Inside, it's a little too fancy for our pool-wear, although all but one of us had coverups. So we are decoding what to do, when a server tells us we are dressed inappropriately. We say that we know...we were going to eat on the patio and now we are just standing there deciding what to do (ps the restaurant is completely empty except for about five servers who are glaring at us.) \\nWe go back outside where my elderly father needs to sit down for a moment. Normally after a chilly reception like that I would have left immediately, but my dad can't walk very far, the rest of the party is hungry, and we had really been looking forward to Roy's. \\nThe server comes outside where we are standing (except for my dad who had to sit down) and confronts us. I explain that its my birthday, that we have been loyal Roy's customers in Hawaii and here, and that we just want to have a nice meal.  I explained that we weren't trying to offend anyone and that there really aren't any other customers to offend right now any way. She tells me that I'm being rude and that she is letting us know about the dress code because she doesn't want her manager to see us and come confront us (so instead she does the honors, I guess.) I am so astounded by how outright MEAN this woman is. It baffling. She looks like she's early 50's or so...you think she would know how to handle a dress code concern better. \\nSo the manager comes out, tries to smooth things over, tells us we're all dressed just fine except for one of our well-behaved kids, who needs a shirt with sleeves. Reminds us that there's a sign that says that too (expert managers always point to the policy) Tells us that we won't have that woman as our server. She'll give us \\\"Debbie, who is fantastic like me.\\\" Okay. Ha ha. Come in. \\nWe get $100+ worth of appetizers and drinks because the full menu is not available yet. Debbie the server is fine. We watch the sun go down through the window. The only good thing about sitting inside is the fantastic live music by Jared Blackstone.  There is also a a very nice server named Tanner, who had brought my dad some water while we were standing on the patio. He comes over and apologizes to us because he has witnessed this whole thing. He's a class act. Kudos to him and I hope he can get a job at an establishment that values service as much as he does. \\nThe manager never came back by our table. We didn't stay for dinner. Instead we walked across the resort to The Blue Sage, where we enjoyed a great meal on the patio on a  gorgeous night. \\nThe experience at Roy's was one of the all-time worst I have ever experienced in my life."}

{"_id": 0, "text": "Such a sad review to write. Let me start by appeasing the disbelievers, I am originally from New York but grew up in Delaware right down the street from the Capriottis by the New Castle airport. Growing up I ate there at least three times a week consuming large amounts of Cheese steaks, Italians and Bobbys over a 22 year span. Military service moved me away from my beloved sandwich shop and I crave Capriottis often. Every trip home the first thing I do even before seeing family is stop for a meal, usually a small steak, Italian and bobby to split with myself, wife and son. Being a die hard loyal Caps fan I was disappointed after eating here. We took a trip north for the recent bike week and stopped off for a meal. The steak was flavorless and dry, bread was chewing inside like it should be but dry and crumbly outside like it was left out for hours prior to service. Bobby was good like back home except the stuffing was off and tasted a bit of stove top and the bread was the same as the steaks. I know Caps, and if the Margolets \\\"founders\\\" saw this they would be ashamed. I won't be back..... Avoid at all costs, the authenticity is lacking in a major way and the food is substandard."}

We were starving, so for convenience my coworker and I decided to have dinner at Casa Nicola.  What a HUGE mistake. \\nI looked at the menu and the price was high for a Italian restaurant but figured the food must be that good.  Boy was I wrong. \\nMy coworker ordered a Seafood Linguine (forgot the exact name) and I ordered the Ossobuco (veal) with creamy Risotto rice which is supposed to be one of their signature dishes. (according to their website) We also ordered some napa valley Merlot to compliment my dish. The wine was pretty good, but that was about it. Actually my Ossobuco was horrid. The meat was very tough (this is veal mind you), dry: almost like they had the meat precooked, left out and then warmed it in a steamer or something, and the sauce just reeked of butter. The risotto just sucked and tasted like I was scooping up butter into my mouth. I have not had Italian like this even at Olive garden. At least the food there compliments the price, my dish alone was $37.99. Ridiculous~!!! for the quality of food that they serve here. My Coworker is pretty much a food connesoir and thought the food was horrible. (obviously his pasta sucked too) \\n\\nI do not mind paying good money for good quality food but this place is not that. The food is not just average...it is horrible. \\nI have enjoyed food far superior at places like Maggiano's which is a lower grade restaurant in terms of price than Casa Nicola. \\nDO NOT THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY HERE!!!

{"_id": 0, "text": "I've come here twice. Both times the vet tried to up-sell lots of tests and prescription pills. \\n\\nThe first time I thought they really were recommending what is for the best- and I actually did get the Xrays that they advised, though I had them done at a different vet's office, because it was significantly less expensive. (Those xrays didn't explain any of the problems either). The 2nd time, when I brought a stray dog in that looked significantly underweight. The vet said  she could feel the dogs liver... and as she began to explain the next part she hid her hands in her pockets, a classic move made by a person when not being forthcoming, and said it could be a mass, but it could also be because the dog is skinny. She said the dog looked pretty good other than that and she'd write up a action plan for getting the dog back in good health. She then left and sent in a tech with a itemized bill for blood work and shots over $500 worth. \\n\\nI then attempted to clarify what I came in for. I wanted to know the dogs health, if the dog appeared neglected or sick and what to do to help the dog gain the weight back. I wanted to know roughly how old the dog was, and what I could do to help the dog get healthy. I've never owned a dog before. I also said, I noticed the dog seemed stiff and I could hear her joints pop when she moved sometimes, and I would like information that could answer questions like, Should I give the dog glucocamine?\\\". Is it an injury or just because of the age? The tech left to speak with the vet again, and then returned and said, the vet says the dog is about 5, though we can't really confirm that. Here is the Prescription she wrote up. \\n\\nAt this point, I was very aggravated. I exclaimed that I wanted information, dietary advice. My main concern was that the dog was underweight due to lack of food. I want to know things like what type of food is best to help the dog recover. I've NEVER even had a dog before, which I said when I made the appointment and stated several times throughout the appointment. The tech looked baffled, and I told her that I was not going to return to this clinic ever again. I went to pay and I told them that I felt swindled. I explained that I still didn't even have answers for simple questions on what type of food is best to feed an underweight dog, and I didn't understand why their office couldn't give basic care advice and instead just kept writing up quotes for tests and drugs. \\n\\nAt that point the tech came to the front and said she talked to the vet and the vet wanted me to have a handout about arthritis. I admit, I sarcastically thanked her for giving me information that I could have easily looked up myself online, and explained that now I still need to look up dietary information online and I think it's ridiculous that I should have to do that when I just paid $50 to talk to a veterinarian and have the dog examined. \\n \\nI left promising to contact the Better Business Bureau. Which I probably will do. \\n\\nI'm just at a point in my life where I'm sick of not getting what I pay for. Is anyone with me on this? It's like I can even by an f%#^$^% sweater that won't unravel in a month because everything is made in China by 5 year olds, I buy used cars around 60,000 miles, because new cars are put together so shoddy that used cars with that kind of mileage already have new transmissions and alternators and starters... The repairs are better quality than what you actually get when you buy the car, unless you get a mechanic that insists that you have replace a $500 part in order to fix a $200 part, when 3 other people gave you quotes that didn't include that repair- or an electrician that insists the lighting in your business needs to be replaced or the lights aren't going to turn on, but when they find out that there isn't anyway to authorize that type of repair a miracle from heaven unfolds and the lights magically work once again. \\n\\nHere's the truth people. Everyone's out to get your hard earned money, and few ever offer quality service or merchandise in return. \\n\\nThis veterinarian could have given me some advice like, since she's under weight you might want to feed her a puppy kibble or some wet food, or increase the portion- and also it wouldn't be a bad idea to do some blood work to see her overall general health. I could respect that, but not offering any advice on the animal whatsoever except for the tests and drugs, seems a bit ridiculous. And if they can't tell me anything about the health of the animal without the tests, then someone explain to me WHY ON EARTH THEY ARE ALLOWED TO PRESCRIBE DRUGS? If you are that clueless as to the health of the animal without your $500 full work up, then how can you in confidence recommend $50 worth of prescription drugs? \\n\\nThe only redeeming quality that I have to mention about this place, is the techs are nice and friendly."}

A game where it snows indoors at regular intervals. A game that the home team wins with a final score of 3-2. Today was a great time.

Whether for todays Winter Classic, the charitable Guns and Hoses game (cops vs fire department in conjunction with the Wranglers), or just a general regular season game. I wish Las Vegas would get behind the Wranglers a little more than they do. They have been around for 10 seasons and have performed well. Maybe if we, as a community, get behind the Wranglers and prove we like this fast paced sport, we can finally get a major league sports team. If you haven't checked out the Wranglers, go.

Close to rue St. Catherine a major shopping street.  It is also right next to Montreal's Chinatown.   The price was right for the location.  \\nThey offer a continental breakfast that featured bagels, croissant, banana bread, yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, beans, cheese, mixed fruits, cereal, and our favorite an espresso machine that makes cappuccino and lattes. The hours are 6am-10am during the week and 6am to 11am on weekends. \\nThe room had a fridge, Apple desktop computer, coffee pot, and LCD TV. It also had free WiFi. The bathrooms are spacious and nicely designed.  The rooms have a modern, but welcoming feel with wooden looking floors.  You need a key card to use the elevator adding extra security.  The female staff at the front desk were attentive and helpful, but not all the staff were such.  \\nCons:  Biggest con was the parking recommended was at the Convention Center two blocks away for $24/day.  So this is an add on to your cost if you are traveling my car.  If, there had been a lot of snow this would have been a pain to walk with any luggage.  There was a lot nearer outside, but when we say a car with its window broken out in the street, I would recommend you use the lot they recommend.

{"_id": 0, "text": "I went in for the lunch buffet and I will never return.  There are better buffets with greater selections around the same price.  The selection here was limited compared to other chinese buffets I have been to, and what they did have was low quality and low on taste.  The pork was chewy and seemed old, I spit it out after taking a bite.  I don't know how one makes teriyaki chicken taste bad, but they were sure successful here because the sause was greasy and the chicken chewy (probably low quality meat).  The sweet and sour sauce tasted weird, and the hot mustard was not hot and seemed watery.  I only ate some of the chow mein and fried rice, both of which wasn't great either.  \\n\\nI am not quite sure how this place is in business, with the quality of the food.   I did not try any dinner menu items - so I will withhold judgment, though I will never return to find out for sure."}

When I walked in I was greeted by a young girl with a smile, who seemed to really want to help me get what I needed.  They had samples of their flavor of the month, which was White Chocolate Blueberry.  Absolutely heavenly!!  I ended up buying 3 of the bundtettes.  Chocolate chocolate chip, white chocolate blueberry, and cinnamon swirl.  I go nuts for anything cinnamon, so that was a front runner for me.  Perfect balance of cinnamon and cake.  Chocolate one was just a little too chocolately for my liking, but moist and tasty nonetheless.  The -1 star is only because I think they are a little pricey.  But for the occasional treat, I won't complain!"}

{"_id": 1, "text": "I have been a patient of Arizona Family Care, with a primary care physician of Dr. Heidi Bannister, since - well, to be honest, I don't remember. Since before 2006 for sure. Dr. Bannister has always been friendly and attentive, with a caring demeanor. In fact when I changed jobs in early 2006 and found that my new insurance did not cover her, I was rather upset - and very happy when I found that my new employer's insurance (in 2007) covered her. \\n\\nTo put it another way: I live near the northern intersection of the I-17 and the 101. This office is Glendale, just off the 101 on Union Hills. It's easily a 15 minute drive to the office, and there are plenty of doctors nearer to where I live.\\n\\nYou may then question why I have given her office a two-star review.\\n\\nIn December I had an appointment with Dr. Bannister, as a follow-up for a head cold and eye problems that I was having. She asked that I schedule a follow-up appointment for a month out, so I stopped and scheduled one for mid-January.\\n\\nI received the reminder call the Friday before the appointment, and realized that I had forgotten to ask for the time off work, so I would not be able to make the visit. Fully intending to call, I wound up with a number of critical issues dumped on me toward the end of the day, and it slipped my mind. I did not think of it again until Monday morning, when I noticed the reminder card on my desk. By that time the appointment was well-past, so I decided I would simply go ahead and wait until the next time I needed to go in for refills or whatnot.\\n\\nA few days later I received a letter from the doctor's office. I figured it was a reminder that I had missed the appointment. To my surprise, I opened it to find a letter from the office, signed by the doctor, that they were dropping me as a patient. The reasoning?\\n\\nThree missed appointments - one in 2007, another last year, and then the one a few days ago (Jan 2012).\\n\\nNow, don't get me wrong, I understand that missed appointments can lose an office money and cause issues for other patients. However:\\n\\n1. The doctor NEVER mentioned to me in any of the intervening appointments I had in 2011 and this last appointment that this was their policy, nor is it mentioned in any of their documentation (I just went to their website and double-checked).\\n\\n2. In every case that I had a missed appointment, I was charged a $25 missed appointment fee - in two of the cases, $5 more than my insurance co-pay (which I understand is only partial compensation since the visit is actually far more than that) that I paid.\\n\\n3. In one of those cases (the appointment in 2010) I actually DID call the office the evening before to cancel, but because of voice mail problems I was unable to leave a message. I paid the $25 missed fee anyway the next time I went in, because I liked the doctor's office and didn't want to make a fuss.\\n\\nFor whatever reason the impersonality of the letter bothered me. My first thought was to call the office but to be honest it's too much of a hassle; there was no diplomacy here, so if they do not want me as a customer, I do not want them.\\n\\nI would suggest to the office that they include this policy on their paperwork, and to call 48 hours before an appointment instead of the day before (when they require 24-hours' notice of cancellation).\\n\\nKeep this in mind the next time you visit the doctor; apparently the friendly relationship you perceive with your doctor only lasts until you've inconvenienced them a handful of times over the course of 5 years; then you're out the door."}

On our way to AC, she mentioned that she and her coworkers have lunched here on several occasions, and her favorite is the chicken pita with tzadziki sauce and a side salad.  I asked if it was called chicken shawarma, and she replied no, so I gathered that she was speaking of grilled chicken pita with tzatziki sauce with the usual salad stuffing (lettuce, tomatoes, pickle).  We arrived and found a couple of people waiting to order, as well as a few waiting for their take-out orders.  I spied an elderly couple cooking in the kitchen, and I assumed their son or a relative was manning the counter and register.  Based on the food I had here, I'd readily give 4 stars, but long wait times, which could've been easily rectified by adding another cook (or two) plus another person to help the slow order-taker/cashier/server/busser, warrant 2 stars or even less!\\n\\nSister ordered two #31's (marinated chicken breast sandwich; $5.50) and two Greek side salads ($1.95 each).  All sandwiches come with tomato, onions, and lettuce with tzadziki sauce and wrapped in a grilled pita.  I ordered the Greek gyro salad ($6.95), minus the cucumbers and salad dressing, but add more feta crumbles, please.  (I've included photos of a sandwich.)\\n\\nI wish I could remark on the chicken sandwiches, but sadly for me, the tzatziki sauce was all over them.  They looked scrumptious, though!  My sis said that AC's cucumber sauce is the best she's ever tried.  Mom says she's had better- we've eaten at many mediterranean restaurants over the years.  I LOVED the gyro!  Awesome grill tan, and the flavors were spectacular, not in the least bit greasy, and I looked forward to and relished every bite!  The salad bed on which the gyro was resting on was equally tasty, even though the dressing, which I had requested to be omitted, was included; It added the perfect tang and spices to the dish- definitely worth a few hours of discomfort.  Really liked the salty feta.  \\n\\nI'd definitely return on my next visit to the Queen City... I'd go back in a heartbeat on this visit if there weren't so many other places I'd like to check out (and yelp about) first!\\n\\nOne small complaint- the kitchen had run out of \\\"yellow\\\" rice, which I assumed to be seasoned with saffron.  Shame, since I love saffron rice, and it would've been nice to try their version of it.

{"_id": 3, "text": "I have lived at Desert Club apartments now for four months and feel I've had enough time to give my opinion on the place... \\n\\nThe Good: Convenient location to everything in Scottsdale and highway access, gated community, the pool is never too busy and great for relaxing with nice chairs, very quiet community and I hear no noise inside my apartment (top floor though), feels safe, nicer finishes in kitchen with the tile floor and granite counter tops, quick maintenance response times, ample visitor parking in rear of complex, nice gym, staff is usually friendly and helpful. Unique floor plans with lots of cabinet space in the A2 floor plan. \\n\\nThe Bad: Single entrance into complex can be annoying, grassy area's in between buildings smell like urine from all the pets, pool could use a cleaning more often (leaves and debris at the bottom) and there is constantly yellow caution tape around the hot tub (not sure what's that about), almost non-existent resident functions, efficiency of the AC in my 3rd story unit seems poor (the AC is always running), glass block window in A2 floor plan lets in a lot of heat (my apartment faces East and West), breezeways and stairs are sometimes littered and are dirty with accidents from pets. The kitchen has a spray/stream faucet which comes in handy a lot but there is no option to add a water filter. The water here isn't too great so I've had to resort to buying bottled water.\\n\\nTips: Before moving in, make sure you get the code to the entrance gate if you are moving in early in the morning or on a weekend. We didn't have the gate code for the moving company and it caused a bit of nightmare. Also, for efficiency sake, I'd request a North or South facing apartment.  \\n\\nSummary: I looked at a LOT of places in Scottsdale for an apartment before settling at Desert Club and I would probably do it all over again if I had to. The minor items on the bad list, though there are several, aren't enough to outweigh the good of the place for me so I generally enjoy living here.  I almost chose Barossa across the street but opted for Desert Club because of the larger pool and the additional square footage in the one bedroom."}

PPG Place is almost straight down the first base line, so sit around third base.  I went to a night game here, and watching the city lights come on was a real treat.  \\n\\nFrom the airport, go east on I-376 (formerly I-279) the Penn-Lincoln Parkway.  This road winds through hills until you get to the Fort Pitt Tunnel.  Coming out of the tunnel, you emerge suddenly into the wide, open spaces at the confluence of the \\\"three rivers\\\" and the Fort Pitt Bridge over the Monongahela River.

I was skeptical about PB's amazingness before eating here, so my expectations really weren't that high.  \\n\\nWe ordered the Wiseguy pizza and added mushrooms.

I wonder what the regular price for this place is.\\n\\nThe check-in was a breeze. Service was top notch. Everyone was polite, but I got a sense of surly but impersonal service. A bit like dealing with an automated machine, if that makes sense.\\n\\nOur room at the Palazzo was one of the best rooms I have stayed in my life. The room was very spacious (about 800 sq. ft.) -- as big as our apartment, and the bathroom is bigger than our bedroom!!! All marble, beautifully appointed. 3 flat screen TVs!!!!!! Opulent.\\n\\nI paid extra $65 for a view. Well, the view was ok, but I'm not sure if it's worth additional $65. I was excited to see the Treasure Island Siren/Pirate show from our room, but the show was canceled during our stay. Boo~ \\n\\nThe wireless connection was strong. The roman shade and curtain are controlled by a remote. The curtains blocked out the bright Las Vegas strip light completely.\\n\\nHowever, the sheets were not as luxurious as everything else in the room. I felt like I was sleeping under a sheet of paper! Yes, it hurt my skin. The pillows aren't very comfortable either -- a little too soft for me.\\n\\nWe signed up for Club Grazie online and got a $15 gambling credit. Free money, sweet~ The slot machines paid out pretty well, although it could have been the beginner's luck. I earned $328 with the $15 credit. :D \\n\\nEverything in this hotel is expensive even for Las Vegas standard. At the same time, the casino floor felt much more calm and classier than other places, which I did like.\\n\\nI splurged my winning on a $90 pedicure at the Canyon Ranch spa. Holy crap, that was an expensive pedicure. It was nice, and I got to keep the nail polish, but I felt guilty for spending $90 on a pedicure. Back in Oakland, I can get a full body massage for $90.\\n\\nI would have bumped it up to 5 stars, but here are the reasons why I will not return to Palazzo:\\n\\n1) Smell: If you are sensitive to smell, you will notice a very strong perfume smell permeating outside and throughout the hotel premises. Certain areas -- entry and front desk, etc. exhibit exceptionally concentrated dose of perfume. The same smell exists at the sister establishment, Venetian. I am very sensitive to smell and can't use any scented lotions or deodorants. I felt nauseated during my stay, and I  I ended up leaving the Palazzo because of it. \\n\\n2) Lay out: It's very easy to get lost in this place. The signs aren't very noticeable and it's easy to find yourself inside the Venetian and difficult to find your way back to the Palazzo. I felt involuntarily trapped in the casino and shopping area. It's bad enough that you have to walk through the casino to get to the guest rooms!!!\\n\\n3) Casino waitresses never came around during the 2.5 hours I spent at the slot machines. When I was at the Mirage, I was offered drinks 3 times in 2 hours. \\n\\n4) Pool: The pool area itself is nice, but there is no wait service. \\n\\n5) Linen: As stated above, the sheets hurt my skin. They should provide higher quality linen, since they are charging a handsome amount and selling themselves as a luxury establishment. \\n\\nLas Vegas just isn't my kind of town, and staying at Palazzo was so so."}

The salsa bar was a mess at 7pm as most salsa's were out and didn't seem to be refreshed in quite awhile. Corn tortillas served with meal were very thin and garden variety.

I am a really good customer at Morris Costumes in this location: 4300 Monroe Rd. Charlotte, however during  my last visit I was very taken aback by the woman (older woman) that owns the store.  You have to ask to try on the wigs behind the counter, so I did and then I proceeded to put the wig on and look at it in the mirror by the dressing room. The owner came over and said to the young girl manning the booth \\\"Watch her\\\" as I was trying on the wig in a tone as if I was going to walk off with it!!!!  First of all I am a grown woman who is a faithful shopper, probably one of their best, I have 2 kids and I am a business owner myself why on earth would she ever get the impression I was going to steal her wig is beyond me!  I would never do that and didn't give her any reason what so ever to think I would!  She said it loud and embarrassed me and made me feel like a criminal.  I said, \\\"don't worry I am not going to steal your wig\\\" and that made her get even more of an attitude and she said \\\"I don't want someone like you shopping here, leave\\\"  OMG never in my life has something so surreal like this ever happen to me. The woman sorry to say is delusional.  Not a good vibe with friendly customer service in there, they just eagle eye you thinking the worst which is unfortunate because they had some good items but it makes you not want to give your money to such a crazy person. Although the store is big it's not the \\\"IT\\\" store to go to for costumes, she should be careful because now a days there is a lot of competition out there with Halloween stores opening, so why be treated like that and why support her and give her your hard earned money when you can go somewhere else?  On-line, party city, halloween stores that just open space for the holiday to just name a few!  Get treated with respect when you shop!  I felt very violated."}

For example, as a vegetarian, at Moe's in a burrito I can opt to choose tofu instead of meat and also put in mixed cooked veggies like peppers and onions. Picante does not have a tofu option. I saw a man making peppers, but it was not available when we ordered so I cannot speak to it being available. Also chips and salsa are not included, they are extra.  Now, on to the positive feedback- the burrito itself was pretty good. I ordered a vegetarian burrito with a spinach wrap, white rice, black beans, lettuce, tomato, corn salsa, cheese, guacamole, cilantro, black olives, onions and pico de gallo salsa. It was decent sized and tasty. Went on a Tuesday/yesterday, which has specialty pricing- $5 burritos and $2 tacos. Also noticed that Thursday's specialty pricing is get a free fountain drink with your burrito purchase. Not too shabby!

I wasn't sure about portion sizes, but I decided to go with the smaller portion size.  \\n\\nWhen my food came out, I was disappointed to see three little tiny pieces of chicken (which were mostly bone), rice  with only a couple of sparse beans mixed into the rice, and about half the plate was made up of some sort of slaw (WTH- she didn't tell me slaw came on the plate! I hate slaw, yuck!)  It did have 2 slices of plantains, which were tasty. \\n\\nWhen I dug into it, things didn't really get any better.

I was visiting relatives in the El Mirage area and they live here 2-3 months out of the year and they said Mario's was good based on word of mouth from their friends.

When it says the show starts at 11, doors open at 10:30, at least try to stay close to the schedule. I can be forgiving if its 10, maybe 15 minutes late, BUT DAMN! You start the show at 11:45? To add to that, there was no explanation whatsoever as to the late start. Now if this was on a friday night, then maybe it just might be okay. But since it was on a thursday, I have to get up for work at 6 am. So by the time I got to bed, it was 2 am. \\n\\nSo we sit down at 11:15 thinking it should start soon, maybe 10 minutes. For the next half hour, we hear about 3 announcements stating for us to go get some Tyku alcohol. By the time the show started, some people have left already and some were sound asleep. One thing is for sure, whoever was left was definitely tired.\\n\\nFinally it starts and there is a wild round of applause, probably because it was about damn time! Here is a quick description of the show. CeeLo sings covers of other songs including his own hits while the large screen behind him shows off a lot of graphics, while his sexy backup dancers are dancing along side of him. From time to time he has other performers sing which is a good thing because being the large man that he is, he needs the rest. \\n\\nThe two stars are for when things did go right, it was actually very entertaining.\\n\\nNow for the things that went wrong. The number one thing that bothered me and im sure a lot of people were thinking the same thing was that all the singing performers were singing to recorded music and you can tell that they were lip syncing a couple times. The sound quality was off several times meaning the music was louder than the singer and vice versa. Lastly, the flow of the show was very erratic. There was a period when CeeLo finished a song, walked off the stage, and all the lights went out. I would say for about 5 minutes we sat there and wondered if the show was done or if was a real intermission. Then all of a sudden the next song starts. Huh? No flow whatsoever.\\n\\nI got free tickets to this show but if I paid for it, I would be really disappointed. CeeLo, if you are reading this, im sure you are yelling at your producer or whoever is responsible for how this show is run. Im sure it's not your fault. You are good at what you do and there's no denying that. In my opinion, more work needs to be done. Usually the best singing shows have a live band. That right there would be a start.

The one that was current was the brand new Car Hops, citing 'Reuben' on the menu.   So, since the Strip offerings really are limited when you work there, I decided to go for broke and fulfill the craving while trying out the new place on the block.\\n\\nI had heard a few 'meh' reports from co-workers who tried it once, but was really set on a Reuben.  So I went in, and found it on the menu (at $12.50) and pretty much indeed DID go for 'broke' for a lunch sandwich.  \\n\\nThe burly tattooed man behind the counter 'warned' me that it was huge, and I replied with a 'this is a test, we'll see.'\\n\\nWhen I travel to NYC, say for a long weekend, four out of my six meals will probably be Reubens, because it's the one place (seemingly) on the planet, where you can get a SUPERB Reuben anywhere they serve a Reuben.

And I DO love a good Reuben.\\n\\nI placed the order and paid, and then waited about fifteen minutes, and the gal behind the counter brought it out to me in a styro container in a bag, and I walked it back to the office.

I usually just get brown rice & teriyaki chicken, so I'm typically spared by the fact that they're always out of everything. I always attributed it to the fact that they get a heavy lunch rush, and just don't handle it well.\\n\\nToday, i got there at 11:30 after working a very early morning, expecting piping hot pans of (relatively) fresh-looking food. To my amazement, it was the worst i've ever seen it here; every pan had barely 2 or 3 scoops of food, and it was all picked over with barely any meat in anything, with sauce burnt to the bottom of the pan. It immediately became apparent that they had just reheated last night's leftovers, and hadn't finished making new food for the day.\\n\\nAbsolutely appalling.

As much fun as that sounds not today! Don't you think the hotel should have said something during booking? How about an email prior to arrival? This would at least have given you a chance to move to a different hotel. Here the most insulting part they offered a $50 credit on a $2000 room bill for the inconvenience.

Then ,over-friendly salesmen scramble to sweet-talk you in buying it NOW. the usual low-interest rates , a mere 500 dollar down and all the hype about them assuring you 100 percent that bad credit/no credit would pose no problem and that once you sign up you get the key to your dream vehicle.which i did. and almost 30 days after i got a call from them saying there are some documents i needed to sign which they just overlooked. Lo and Behold when i got there they rudely demanded i pony up another 1500 dollars on top of my 500 dollars because my credit wasnt good enough. i countered with an additional 500 cash and they said they will get back to me after deliberating with the other members of their company. They came back and instead of acceding to my counter, they put on more demands. They now demanded i get a co-signor or else \\\"you can just take a cab\\\" and go home as long as we leave the keys with them.\\nI demanded that they put down their demand in writing so that everything is recorded in black and white, They refused to do so and again said in the most rudest of decorum that they would do us a favor by taking us home because there is no way we can leave the lot without either getting a co-signor or returning the key.  I asked if I could get my 500 back and they said yes but they would have to deduct a \\\"sizeable\\\" amount for my using their vehicle and i would get a trickle of my 500 dollar cash back ,if at all.   I had to accede to their demand because i did load the vehicle with close to 1500 dollars of accessories like GPS, body-enhancement kits and the like and wanted to avoid the embarassment and humiliation.\\nSo in the end i was able to get a co-signor and later on i found out that they intended to put additional charges to the original contract, probably sensing that my co-signor is financially \\\"loaded.\\\"\\nI am examining my legal options. This has caused me great aggravation .   Other prospective car buyers, BEWARE!\\nThe dealership is a total Let-Down! A Total Joke! Rip-Off Artists of the Highest Calibre.\\nThey are just to make a quick buck. They instantaneously give away the key to your desired vehicle because they know that they can earn fat commissions if your credit goes through .And if your credit isnt in the best of shape they know they can always threaten you to get a co-signor or charge you outrageous  through-the-roof car-rental rates .\\nOnce you sign the contract all signs of friendliness disppear and you are left to your own devices. The salesman i talked to admitted that his job is to \\\"sales-talk\\\" and that is what he is being paid to do which means he will stop at nothing and say all those sweet-sounding lies and half-truths til you get bamboozled into signing.

How awesome. 430 comes, 530 comes, 630 comes and they call saying that they got caught on a job with bees. Understandable, but a call before you were gonna be late would have been awesome so I didn't sit around waiting for you. Person said he could come out right then or about the same time the next day. I said right then worked, he then asked if the next day would be ok.... sooooo why did you give me a choice if you weren't going to go with the one I picked? Anyways he offered 50% off to do it the next day around 430, and I'll never say no to cheap stuff. \\n\\nSame thing next day, except this time he called about 530. I didn't even answer because I couldn't believe I fell for it a second time. He left a message saying he didn't want to come out because it was raining, but would if I wanted him to.

Run fellow yelpers, run. \\n\\nIt is one thing to be late and let someone know, it is another to be late four times, and not call till at least an hour later every time.

{"_id": 3, "text": "This review is simply about the quality of the IMAX screen and viewing experience rather than the surrounding environment (AZ Mills Mall). This is the only true IMAX screen in Phoenix. If you see a movie here you will truly be engrossed in the film. The screen is so big that sometimes it even feels as if your stomach drops even if it is not a 3D movie. I've seen several movies here including Prometheus, Dark Knight Rises and most recently Oblivion. Any \\\"space\\\" based movies are especially spectacular on this screen because you really feel like you are there. The bathrooms are a little small but it has never been so busy that I had to wait a long time and they have always been reasonably clean. I will come back to IMAX because I love movies and I especially love feeling like I am part of one."}

The shredded lettuce paired with their house sauce made me feel like I was eating coleslaw. Maybe thats what they were going for? If so- congrats. If not- fix it. \\n\\nThe fries were nothing special either. Greasy and not overly flavorful. Sometimes you get those greasy fries that you can feel how hard you will have to workout to get rid of them, but it is soooo worth it. These not so much. Drenched in grease and blah in flavor. \\n\\nThe soda selection is cool, but I don't drink soda. Maybe just not my kind of place."}

{"_id": 1, "text": "In a word...this experience was underwhelming.\\n\\nI remember coming to Cabo back when they first opened, years ago, and just LOVING the food.\\nHave my tastes matured that much, that what once was awesome, and worth a 40 minute wait for a table just isn't anymore?  Sure, I think maybe they've matured a little, but I really think its just a drop in standards. \\n\\nThe whole night at Cabo was underwhelming, from the time we approached the hostess till we left, with the important exception of the service.  Our server was amazing, and the manager, after a bit of a misunderstanding in a complaint, was very receptive to criticism and feedback.\\n\\nWe arrived at the hostess station at about 6:35pm, and were told there would be a 10-15 minute wait...when there were plenty of open seats. We asked if we could just sit at a bar top, and she said that the servers were busy and had to catch up on their tables.\\n\\nOk, strike one, horribly understaffed.  \\n\\nThen we noticed the time, and noticed that their happy hour ends at 7pm every day.  \\nAre they trying to seat us late so we don't take advantage of happy hour?  Not that there was a lot on the HH menu that we wanted but still...\\n\\nLuckily, we were seated at about 6:50 (ten minutes to spare) and got our order of wings in for $5.\\n\\nOur server, like I said before, was a treasure.  She was pleasant, and kept my water glass full the whole night.\\n\\nIt took a while to get our chips and salsa, which we discovered was because the kid bringing the chips was also the ONLY busser we saw on the floor...which brings in to question:  How are their sanitary practices?  The same guy who is bussing dirty dishes is bringing out our chips and salsa...no gloves.  Hm.\\n\\nThe chips were good, but the salsas were a little...boring.  Another stations property has a Mexican restaurant with a salsa bar, and a MUCH better selection of salsa's.  Boring, and disappointing.  \\n\\nSo our wings arrived, and they were standard wings...nothing to write home about.\\n\\nWhen our entrees arrived, that was where the problems started occurring. \\n\\nMy chimi fajita:   This thing is ENORMOUS.  Like...ridiculously huge, fed me at dinner last night and lunch today, and I STILL didn't eat the whole thing.   It was served with refried beans and cheese, Mexican rice, and a \\\"garnish\\\" of pico de gallo.  The pico was laughable.  If you're serving me pico, I want enough to put ON my chimichanga, and there wasn't enough on the plate for the first bite.  \\n\\nAs far as the flavor goes...it started off mediocre, with mostly just vegetables on the end.  As I got closer to the middle, I found the chicken ,and that was actually pretty nice.  \\n\\nMy fella ordered the steak fajitas, and was REALLY disappointed.\\nFirst of all, he ordered them with NO sour cream...and received his bowl of pico with sour cream in it.  \\n\\nSecond, on the fajita platter, there was ONE lonely, tiny stalk of cilantro.  One.  It was mostly stem too, no leaves. \\n\\nWorse of all though...the steak was bland!  We could have dropped it on the floor and stepped on it, and it would have had more flavor. \\n\\nAt this point, we asked our server to speak to a manager.\\n\\nWhen we told her about the steak being bland, I think she may have misunderstood what we were trying to do, and she said \\\"What would you like me to do to the steak.\\\" \\n\\nUh...yeah.  We got a little angsty after that bit, and stepped up our game, letting her know that we were simply trying to provide feedback, that the quality of the food was bland.  For advertising that the steak is marinated, it didn't taste that way at all.\\n\\nAfter we explained ourselves a bit better, she was VERY apologetic, and offered to take the fajitas off the check (that wasn't  our goal, but since he didn't eat much of it, it was a nice offer that we accepted), and told us how much she valued our feedback.\\n\\nThe best part though, was that she came back out to the table after taking the food back, and said that she tried the steak, and that it WAS bland.  \\n\\nSo the good news is, if she is true to her word, and she seemed like she is the kind of person who cares about her business, she should get on the chefs to season their meat better.  \\nI was torn about giving Cabo 3 stars simply for her change of heart, but at the end of the day, the food just wasn't very good at all. \\n\\nI don't know that I'd come back here again, really...its on the other side of town, and there are better restaurants, but if I'm here and with someone who wants to come out, I probably won't say no.  I'd like to see if they actually make improvements."}
{"_id": 2, "text": "Just had dinner here while staying at the JW Marriott Desert Ridge for a conference.  \\n\\nShort take: overall it was a pleasant and good experience.  I'd come back if I lived in the area and if I didn't mind spending a few bucks.  \\n\\nDetails: The hostesses and wait staff were great; seated me promptly and were able to engage in some nice small talk to get me comfortable.  The dining area was pleasant.  It has some massive stone columns that break the room into somewhat smaller seating areas, making for a cozier dining experience and also helps to shield from noise.  The seats were comfortable, and the table plenty big for a party of two--unlike some other restaurants that really try to cram you into as small of a footprint as possible.  So far so good.\\n\\nNow onto the important stuff: the food and pricing.  The food I got was excellent.  The portions, however, are small.  Luckily for me, they surprised me with a bread board and a couple of other things (unexpected dungeness crab salad mini-bite, and end-of-meal white chocolate truffle).  The bread wasn't the usual bread and olive oil dipping sauce that I'm accustomed to getting at lesser restaurants, but a board with three types of warm artisan bread: a cranberry, a plain sourdough, and a nice green olive encrusted bread.  Six slices in total, I ate all of them.  It would have been a little dry normally, but 4 (count 'em, 4) different spreads and dips made them very edible.  They had an olive oil dip, a buttery spread, a tangy blended mayonnaise dip, and some cooked and oiled cored olive topping dish.  It was a delight to mix and match the types of bread with the types of options.  \\n\\nI started with a caesar salad.  This was pretty good, but you can't really go too far with a caesar.  I've had plenty worse, so I'm sure you get the picture.  I was disappointed by the size though, it was a small soup bowl size (for $10!).  At least there were two fresh anchovies in there.\\n\\nFor the main entree, I ordered their veal ravioli.  This was delicious.  The skin was just right, the meat was tender.  The sauce was a creamy delight, and there was also a secondary plating of a deep green colored sauce that neither added nor subtracted from the taste or texture of the dish.  What was a little weird was the prosciutto they haphazardly tossed on top of it all.  No complaints though, I chopped that up and it added a little extra kick.  In total there were only about eight 1.5\\\" square sized ravioli; plumply stuffed, but a couple more would have been nice...  \\n\\nOne person, no wine, no dessert, no coffee--just iced tea, a salad, and ravioli, and I was up to $41.  I wouldn't have been full without the bread.  If the price was a little lower, say $30-35, I would have given them an extra star."}

Wasn't sure if I was supposed to flag down someone, go up and poor myself, stand in line and pay for another cup. So I played stupid (perfected this move) and asked one of the workings girls as she passed by. She was nice enough to get me a cup. :)\\nFood arrives and we dig in.

Also, celebrity chef restaurants were brought up, and because Wolfgang Puck's Bar and Grill was right by KA, it won!\\n\\nWe were seated in a fairly short amount of time [it was a bit after 9pm on Sunday, but still busy]. The decor was interesting [plaid ceilings and floral glass \\\"walls\\\"]. The restaurant is on a platform overlooking the waiting area for KA and was right near the MGM casino.

There were multiple people who did the water, drinks, and food serving [they did bring out the food to the wrong people, but they got the orders right so what does it matter?].\\n\\nMy mouth was watering just reading the menu, but I wasn't feeling great so I thought I'd pick smaller options--hah! I got Mac'n Cheese and Roasted Cauliflower. The Mac'n Cheese wasn't anything amazing, but it tasted pretty good with the cauliflower in it. Two people at the table got the lasagna, which tasted like regular lasagna, but it did have a nice presentation. My sister got the gourmet burger. It was $25 and SO worth it! She asked for medium, and it was pretty pink and soooo flavorful! It came with thinly sliced and fanned avocado, all the fixings, and incredibly tasty fries. I believe my boyfriend got the Italian sausage pizza with goat cheese, and that was also super tasty and a decent size. \\n\\nThe only complaint we really had was that the ginger lime iced tea did not taste at all gingery.

It had all the ingredients for somewhere I would really enjoy - location near me in City North, nice layout, cool-looking bar and of course, sushi.  I went on Saturday night - the first thing I noticed was that the place was practically empty.  My friend and I were the only two at the sushi bar.  A couple of the teppan tables had guests but otherwise... crickets.  I did not view this as necessarily bad, since I assumed the service would be really good and attentive since there weren't many tables/guests to serve.  Uh... no.  We received menus and ordered drinks from our waitress and then she disappeared.  For a really, really long time.  It was weird...  and quiet... After sitting there for a while, I asked one of the two chefs behind the sushi bar if we could order from him, or if there was a paper menu to fill out.  He said that we had to order from the waitress.  Now that would be OK if we could actually find her.  Finally he took pity on us and made up the hamachi we were looking for.  While the hamachi was really good, the rolls we had later were just OK.  They were creative, but there were too many ingredients and conflicting sauces for my taste.  I guess I prefer a more traditional style.  When it came time to ask for the check, our waitress had again wandered off to who-knows-where.  It took nearly 15 minutes to find another server to ask where she was so we could pay.  Overall, it was not the fun place I was looking for to bring my out of town guest.  Doubt I will be back."}

They made it nice and juicy. \\n\\nAlthough, this place is really expensive for breakfast. For the price, you think you'd get \\\"knock your socks off\\\" type of food. Orange juice was $4.00, AND our waiter didn't even come back to see if my husband wanted more. Which leads me to believe that there's no free refills on that. \\n\\nI guess you can say it's okay if you don't mind spending that much on your breakfast. In Vegas though, you could probably find better for a cheaper price."}

{"_id": 3, "text": "Penn and Teller certainly get one thinking... and one of the topics is \\\"Did I really enjoy the show?\\\"  They are very personable, connect and mingle with the audience (playing the bass in the pre-show or when they turn up the house lights), and convey their continued passion for the craft.  When they supposedly explained how something was done, I anticipated that the point would be that they would then do something inexplicable.  Maybe I just didn't get it, but I don't think they added a confounding twist... maybe I miss that touch of slickness.  I want to be wowed in a magic show, and the fire eating, flag burning (obviously more flimsy than the one they had folded), nail gun, and newspaper tearing just didn't do it.  I guess Penn's tour de force rants make the show transcend your typical magic show; I loved catching a glimpse of his palmed ball of foil - you also glimpse his humanity.  I hope Teller isn't really mute... I think he was talking during the post-show photo-op... and does that camcorder bit mean we heard him speak!?  Penn's a great actor if that was scripted!  I guess I have to conclude that it was a worthwhile show for its blend of comedy, illusion, and commentary.  \\nI wonder if they implanted a subliminal message about getting dessert afterwards (okay, he said it out loud).  Too bad we didn't look at our ticket stub because there was a coupon for free dessert attached!

Not particularly a fan of the spiky haired celebrity but able to appreciate his place in pop-culture it was with an open mind that I approached the doors of the Linq-side locale and greeted by a hostess plus a surprising lack of 'branding' (compared to the likes of Ramsay, Puck, or even Batali) we were quickly led to a table, the service to follow effusively friendly and surprisingly efficient with questions she could not answer deferred to visits from the GM and chef himself.  Every bit the lively scene one would expect of a 'tatted-up' venue spilling from indoors to out yet far less loud than many thanks to high ceilings, reclaimed woods, and plenty of glass it was with the first of several cups of Stumptown Coffee in hand that our morning began and with The Doors alternating to country tunes and 70s hits overhead it would not be long before our savory course arrived, each plate well-crafted with subtle nuances to be discovered amidst decidedly conspicuous portions as the biscuit proved amongst the best in Vegas while the chili walked a fine line between heat and sweet, the white cheddar lending a sharp salinity at the top of each bite.  Always a sucker for sweets it was onward to the griddle that our meal progressed and again investing in a duo I was immediately impressed by the toothsome cornmeal pancakes enveloping a core of butter cookies and fresh fruit only to then be let down by the French Toast that was simply too 'wet' with custard to stand up to the heavily sugared bacon and sugar-torched fruit, the amalgam altogether too sweet and in need of some sort of textural variance - perhaps something along the lines of a trip to the deep-fryer in order to crisp the bread as was done in the case of a 'Monte Cristo' more than happy to eschew any fa\\u00e7ade of healthiness as smoky marshmallow fluff encased in golden brioche found balance in cinnamon spread and rich chocolate, the housemade raspberry preserves a nod to the classic adding a fruity finish that lingered long on the palate."}

{"_id": 2, "text": "We tried Five Guys for the first time this weekend.  The food is very good and you get big portions so you don't leave hungry.  However the burger where actually very greasy.  We did not realize that the regular burger are all double patties, for a normal size burger you get what they call a little burger.  I would not normally order a double bacon cheese burger, but I did not realize this fact until our food arrived.  There is no sign letting you know they are double patty burgers.  It's cool that they have a whole list of topping and you just choose whatever you want on the burger.  Every thing is made fresh and to order.  Word of caution to those who have peanut allergies, everything is cooked in peanut oil and they have boxes of peanuts lining the entry way.  The place is very clean and the people working seemed very nice.  \\n\\nThe reason I only gave it 3 stars instead of 4 stars is due to the high price.  I would say this is in no way a 5 star place.  This is basically a glorified fast food place.  You come in and stand in line to order get your number and drinks and wait for them to yell out your number.  Weather or not you are dining in you get your food in a paper bag.  However, you pay prices like going to Red Robin or some sit down place, and the quality is not that of a sit down place.  My suggestion is to go a block down to Trop. and have In-N-Out and pay a fraction of the price or go someplace where they don't yell out numbers for you to pick up your food.  For 3 people (2 adults and 1 child) we paid almost $40, at In-N-Out we usually pay about $20.  I don't mind these prices if I am not having to stand in line to order and getting my food in a paper bag and then sitting in hard metal and plastic chairs.  \\n\\nSo my advice save the money and go to another fast food place, or spend maybe $10 more and go someplace where you can sit and have your order taken and get the higher quality."}

It seems like a great business model, small space, great smell, capturing a liberal market they're not a part of, low overhead, and high return (even better if their company car is biodiesel, which if it's not, then it should be) if their donuts can stop being so mediocre I might raise my review. I'll keep an eye out for the yelp score to jump a little, then I'll go back."}

I had a little and it was tasty but not spectacular.  Nice big chunks of lobster which was a nice surprise.  \\n\\nI had the Pecan Crusted Trout.  The fish itself was so-so, not much seasoning and the portion was small.  It comes with a peach/cilantro salsa on top that I didn't care for and scraped off.  The star on the plate was the side of tortilla slaw.  Red cabbage, carrots, tortilla strips in a vinegary dressing.  I ate all of that and could have eaten more.\\n\\nTheir bread...to die for.  I could have been happy sitting there eating just that with butter and they could have charged as much as my entree and still I'd be happy. \\n\\nThe birthday girl had the Aspen Sirloin and said it was just okay.  My other friend ordered the French Dip Sandwich but she was so into her side dishes that she filled up too fast and didn't even try it.  I'll let you know if she says it was good as leftovers.  The side that she said was great was the Southwest Au Gratin Potatoes.  \\n\\nThe birthday girl loved her free dessert, the Big Daddy Chocolate Cake.  I love a low-key birthday dessert presentation and Firebirds did it well, just a candle and a happy birthday wish, no songs.  The portion of gooey chocolate cake was huge, with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce on the side.  Very yum.\\n\\nService was great, drinks were refilled frequently.  The staff was patient with us, not asking us to clear out as we sat chatting even though the dinner crowd was descending.  \\n\\nOne note about the parking...it was fine when we got there around 3:45 but it was a death match as we were leaving.

However, today my daughter wanted to go and use the credit that she had from a previous trade and they had moved to 43rd ave and Peoria in the same parking lot as the Ross.  This location is not good and this is the reason I gave them one star.  It was really hot in there, I don't know if the A/C was broken of they just hadn't turned it on yet. There was a huge fan in the back of the store, but they didn't even have it turned on.  The location was dirty looking and smelled like the typical thrift store.  The dressing rooms were even hotter and laking clothing hooks to hang the clothes.   The clothing was not labeled with small, medium or large...only a very few of them had that.  This location was much smaller as well, so the selection was very small.  The staff was friendly, as usual.  The 43rd ave and Cactus location was much larger, with more of a selection and always very clean and smelt really good! Everything was always in its place and labeled and the dressing rooms were nice.  \\n\\nI don't know how long they have been open at the new location, so maybe they just haven't had the time to get everything up to par, hopefully they will do some extra work and give the location a little bit of \\\"elbow grease\\\" to make it more appealing.   I don't understand why they moved, but it wasn't a good choice.  The new location doesn't even have a sign saying who they are.  My daughter did manage to find some clothing while we were there.  Overall, due to ambience of the new location my daughter and I feel that we would not like to return to the new location, which is a shame.

{"_id": 2, "text": "After quite a few mentions in a YT thread a while back, I bookmarked this spot and have been dying to try it. I really, really wanted to like it, but it just fell short...\\n\\nWhen we first arrived, it wasn't all that busy. Maybe 4-5 other tables sat, and no one was waiting at the front to order from the display. We basically went ungreeted and were just met with blank stares. They did get us sat pretty quickly, but past that, I just wasn't a huge fan of the service. Our waiter had a very awkward way about him and made no attempts to greet us, or really talk to us at all. He just took our orders and brought the food. Maybe that's the way they want it? I don't know, but by the time we had gotten our food, the place was completely packed and the service from there on was virtually non-existent. Aside from having a very friendly and enthusiastic woman, I'm assuming the owner, visit us one time at the beginning of the meal, the service was lacking in a big way.\\n\\nWe started off our meal with their complimentary bread basket and an order of the Lasagna Explosion. Their take on the classic bread basket is pretty cool and those little garlic knots are quite addicting. The Lasagna Explosion wasn't quite as good as I expected though. I went to cut one in half to see the inside and it actually exploded out a ton of water. Yup, just clear water. Their sauce here is just way too watery, almost to the point where it has very little to no flavor. Apart from that, I liked that the Explosion is packed pretty good with cheese and it's a good size appetizer for $8, but it was just okay at best and I wouldn't recommend them.\\n\\nOn the menu itself, there's actually a ton of choices. If you're in the mood for pizza, they have that. If you're in the mood for a classic pasta dish, they have that. If you're in the mood for seafood, they have that. I could go on, but it's pointless. For as small as the place is, I was really surprised to see how many things they offer and there's bound to be something for everyone. I ended up ordering the Cavatelli with Broccoli Rabe and hot sausage. As I expected, the pasta was cooked perfectly. However, the amount of sausage in the plate was a bit disappointing and since the pieces were so tiny, it added very little to the overall taste. The broccoli rabe was decent though. It wasn't bitter and had great texture. All in all, just another okay dish.\\n\\nAs far as pricing goes, it's actually not too bad. We only ended up spending a little over $80 before tip, for 4 adults and 1 child. Since there's other things on their menu that I'd like to try, mainly dessert items like the chocolate canoli, I would possibly stop by again if I was in the area. But with mediocre service and okay food, I can't say I'd be coming back for the regular food anytime soon."}

But I digress....\\n\\nP.U.B is one of my total mainstays when I'm in Vegas. Now granted, I have somewhat of a blurred point of view regarding Vegas seeing as how  my family lives there and I'm there practically there half of my year, but I have to say- I rarely have found a place in Vegas where I crave a specific thing over and over again. And it has got to be the Dirty Chips at PUB. Think about how mind-blowingly amazing it must have been for Todd English to put THAT together. (b/w you and me, it HAD to have been after a night of him being stoned off his mind or something). House made kettle chips, blue cheese, cheese sauce, pancetta, green onions, and fried chicken livers- yes, you heard me correctly- fried chicken livers! It is like a stoner's fantasy. But even if you're not a chicken liver fan- the chips are to die for. I mean- I would actually kill for them right now! Really. No...really! \\n\\nOther than that, everything else I've had there has been delicious. The Pot Pie. The Shepherd's Pie. The Onion Rings. Now I didn't have that all in one sitting....what am I? A heifer? But the true nature of the PUB is the chill atmosphere and to top it off, and amazing selection of beers. I highly recommend sitting at the bar to eat and you can get some one-on-one edumacation about some of the beers and sometimes they serve limited quantity, hand-crafted beers, and you can sometimes ask to taste some. To top it off, they actually have a great wine selection too. For those non-beer drinkers who don't feel like being gassy. Cause in Vegas....sometimes gassy is NOT classy."}

That's pretty pathetic. I got the buffalo scramble, which has ground buffalo, onion, bell pepper, tomato, mushroom and jack cheese and comes with toast and hashbrowns. I asked for it with no mushrooms.... no such luck, I got mushrooms. That wasn't a huge deal though. The real problem was the overwhelming lack of any flavor. You would think with that list of ingredients that it would have tons of flavor, but it just tasted like mushy, creamy, nothing. There was way too much cheese and the cheese was bland and nasty.... the buffalo being ground is also not a good idea because it has a weird mouth feel and looks like little turds.... also, buffalo is a beautiful meat, why grind it up? I think the lack of flavor may be because they do not saute the veggies before adding the egg (or at least that's my guess.... not sure) Anyway, I thought maybe the hash browns would be better.... no. Tasted like nothing! WTF? Has this place not heard of seasoning? Finally, the toast was standard, but they only had welch's grape jelly on the table.... for 10$ a plate I should get some nice jam... or at least a choice. So overall, mine was a train wreck. \\n\\nThe BF got the blueberry pancakes that are supposedly so good.... they aren't. They were soo sweet... disgustingly sweet. They drench the pancakes in blueberry sauce of sorts and it is just super sweet... like sweeter than a regular cake or pie....

Once we sat, a server came up and asked if we had just \\\"walked in\\\" and if we needed menus. We said yes, of course, but then she proceeded to tell us that the table was reserved and that any other table would be fine and she would be right with us. We found the only other empty table, and shortly after we sat a man that was with the large party reserving all the tables informed us that that table was reserved as well.

I try to avoid going through a regular cash if at all possible, and will choose to wait for a self service cash, because I have had so many bag experiences with cashiers and baggers.  Everytime I think it's me, I just have to go to PA on Parc or another big chain grocery, to realize that I only have problems here.  With the price of groceries always on the rise, I want to actually be able to enjoy the food I buy.  That means no manhandling my bread, or throwing produce.   It also means not putting my groceries into a million flimsy plastic bags when I have an armfull of sturdy reusable bags that I'm trying to hand over.  Whenever I try to politely to ask the staff to please be a little more careful, or to use my reusable bags, I'm met with standoffish gruff staff.  I once had a cashier yell at me for accusing the packer of squishing my bread.  I didn't accuse him of squishing my bread, I just asked that they not ram the rest of the groceries into it.\\n\\nThe other not so good aspect of things is that the store can get really packed.  Monday through Wednesday evenings student discounts are offered, which means there are a lot more packs of roomates going shopping together.  It's also pretty packed on Sunday afternoon due to the proximity to tamtams.  And forget popping in on your way home from work to pick up something for dinner if you work a standard 9 to 5, you'll be there for quite awhile.  \\n\\nSo I get around all of the above by going early on the weekends, when the store is empty and I have my choice of self serve machines."}

Well . . . here it goes, fingers crossed!\\n\\nWe had been here for dinner a few times and were very pleased, we decided we needed to try their happy hour.  I'm so glad we did; this is one of my new favorite quiet happy hour spots.  Not quite as trendy as Va Bene, but that's a good thing.  Less of a singles scene, less noisy and the food is just as delicious!  Happy hour is M-F 5-7.\\n\\nWe walked in a few minutes after 5 and were greeted by a very friendly bartender.  He kindly brought us menus and explained that during happy hour all wines by the glass are $5.  Wonderful!! He brought us some water (with a slice of cucumber, nice touch), took our drink orders, and gave us a few minutes to decide on food.\\n\\nIn addition to the wine specials, there are happy hour food specials! Half off bruschetta, pizza, and other appetizers.  We went with the Calamari In Umido (large tube calamari saut\\u00e9ed in white wine & clam broth with a touch of tomato) and the Margherita pizza. They make their own mozzarella here, people!!\\n\\nBefore we received the appetizers, the bartender gave us some fresh bread with oil and balsamic to snack on.  The calamari came out first and it was fabulous, as was using the free bread to sop up the amazing broth!  Then came the pizza and while it didn't blow me away, it was still very good and that mozzarella is so creamy and fresh!  \\n\\nAs embarrassed as I am to admit it, we got three rounds of that yummy bread to use for that delicious broth of the calamari.  The best part, the bartender didn't seem to mind a bit that we were being a little greedy with the free bread!  What a nice guy!  Did I mention the bread and broth were delicious?\\n\\nThe bar area is nice with a small-ish size bar and a few high-top tables.  My favorite part was the living room set up past the bar.  Some comfy couches and a projection screen.  I can't wait to plan a friendly group happy hour so we can lounge around on the couches drinking wine and snacking on appetizers.\\n\\nThe service was great, the food was great, the price was right, and the atmosphere is cool and cozy.  What more can a girl ask for?  A couple more times like this, and this is a five star rating . . . easy!"}

{"_id": 1, "text": "I went to Marquee and did not enjoy my experience.  We had gone to XS, Surrender, Hyde, and Haze throughout our week in Vegas, and had bottles every night.  That being said, the issue with Marquee is that there is no air of exclusivity, in that, the line is very long, but it seems like by the end of the night every single person that was in line is packed into the club like a bunch of dying fish.  We went on the night Chuckie was performing, and it literally took 30 minutes to explore this massive club (due to the sardine factor).  Even with a bottle, we were not having a very good time.  Our bottle waitresses were rude, and they decided to close down our section (after paying nearly $800 for our single bottle of Belvedere).  They offered to move us but since we had a quarter of a bottle left, and we were nearly out, they basically said buy another one and we'll move you, and if not we'll just stare at you till you feel pressured enough to leave.  I very nicely approached them in their staring contest and let them know I did not appreciate their staring contest, to which they insisted it was not what it seemed and continued to stare at us.  \\n  I have had Skyboxes at LIV, have tables 2-3 times a week here in DC, have been to Vegas 3 times in the past year, gone to clubs in NYC (near where I grew up) constantly, and have never had a more pompous and underwhelming experience.  I am sure if you come here with $5k-10k to spend you will have a wonderful time, but for that money, I would hop a flight to Miami, and go to LIV, which I will continue to argue is the best nightclub in the world (especially their skyboxes), as there is an air to exclusivity and service that is simply incomparable to any other experience I have ever had.  All of my friends decided that Hyde @ Bellagio is the perfect place for us in Vegas, they are more reasonable, more exclusive, and the view can't be beat, inside and out.    Also people seem to be there to have a great time, not just say they went there.  Skip this place, not like you will, as everyone says it's the greatest club in the world, and inevitably you will make the same mistake we made..."}

However, I'm glad I trusted my gut (not the hungry part, the sensible part)!\\n\\nWhen I walked in, the dining room was absolutely packed! Obviously, it's a popular destination. So, I took a minute to see what looked best to me. After a few minutes perusing their menu, I opted for the Shrimp Burrito. The young lady behind the counter informed me that it would take about five minutes for my order to be ready. So, I took my drink to the dining room and waited.\\n\\nAs I was waiting, I passed by their full bar. I wasn't really in the market for an alcoholic beverage during lunch, so I didn't really price anything. The fact that this bar exists, though...that's the important thing! The self-serve chips and salsa bar was really cool! It's similar to ones that you would find at Baja Fresh, except for the endless chips. That's a pretty nice touch, in my opinion.\\n\\nAfter about five minutes (a touch longer, but I wasn't in a hurry), my burrito was ready. Size wise, my burrito was comparable to ones that you find at Chipotle or Qdoba. However, the difference maker for me was the actual content. I made sure to pay extra close attention to the amount of shrimp contained in my burrito. I've been burned at places before when they skimped on contents. Not here. EVERY single bite I took was accompanied by a full shrimp...and I don't take small bites. For $8.85, I was definitely impressed. \\n\\nIf you're in the market for a sort of change of pace with regards to your Mexican food, you should check out Blue Burrito Grille. If you need more incentive, they do have a couple of televisions, free Wi-Fi, and a nice patio. The patio is covered by umbrellas, but it doesn't have misters or anything like that. So, if you want to sit outside, make sure you get in on the action before it gets hot!"}

Second course was a choice of: Wok seared Salmon with Ginger Basil sauce, or Grilled BBQ Korean Short Ribs, or Honey Walnut Shrimp with Lemon Aioli. Since there was four in our group, we easily all shared. The ribs were amazing. Perfectly prepared with a side of kimchee. The shrimp was really good and they were of great size too. The salmon was delicious as well. The ginger basil added just the right amount of zest to the perfectly cooked piece of fish. Nice size portions on all the entrees. Our final course was the dessert trio of: Chocolate Ganache, Lemongrass Gelee with Coconut Tapioca, and finally Lychee Mochi Ice Cream. Each one of us liked different ones for different reasons, so be sure to ask the staff questions based on your personal tastes or desires. I will add that the wine prices were right on line with other restaurants of this price range. Average amount of selections of wines and beers.\\n\\nThis leads me into the staff, OUTSTANDING service! They were on top of everything! We had several questions through out the meal and they directed us in good directions based on our specific tastes. All in all, this was a great meal for the price. The only possible draw back might be the location in the Hard Rock, as it should have been very busy the whole evening. We all said we would go back there again."}

This one you sit down and are served. Both times I went on a Friday night after a movie and it was a little crowded. There may be waiting if there are more than 2 of you, but it's not a long wait if you do. The first time our waitress was good. Last night, the waiter was okay. I'm too busy eating and enjoying the food to really let that part bother me too much. Around 6-7pm last night, it was nice to sit outside on the patio since the sun had already gone down, but if you go earlier, there is shading over the patio.\\n\\nThe cilantro jalepeno hummus is \\\"Ah-mazing!\\\" Don't worry about it being too spicy, because it's just the right amount of spice that balances the cilantro flavor. \\n\\nThe pesto pizza is delicious! We added chicken though which made it more filling! \\n\\nAs other reviewers had said, it feels like everything is so fresh and you don't feel overwhelmed with gluttony once you are done. With the exception of the falafel, not many things are deep fried. Most foods here are grilled or baked. All of the meats and some veggies are marinated, so everything you order is full of flavor."}

I'm telling you it's the business here! They were served with mini toasted bagettes buttered on the grill and the little salad they had on the side was an awesome pairing.I would definitely order it again yummy!\\n\\nSo the waiter recommended that we try the 33oz wagyu tomahawk ribeye and I'm glad we ordered this steak. And for 88 bucks I expected another mediocre steak but boy was I wrong. I asked the waiter when the steak came out if I needed any sauces for this steak and I was thrown off on how he immediately said no trust me eat it as is.. the most awesome steak I've had in my life so far..I was so satisfied from first bite to finish and now look to have this steak on a regular.my wife also agreed and sister and cousin felt that was a phenomenal steak! Thank you so much for the experience\\n\\nOur cousin and sister had the rack of lamb and for me I'm not too much of a lamb guy but they insisted that I try it and I was amazed because normally when I eat lamb it's too gamy for me but this was an awesome prepared lamb chop so thank you for that because it totally changed my perspective on lamb.\\n\\nAs for the sides that we enjoyed with our meal we had lobster mashed potatoes and asparagus and cream corn.they went with our meal and I will say my favorite thing was the cream corn and the recommended lobster mash felt like it was just your simple mash potatoes and gravy with lobster on top..still it was delicious\\n\\nSince we were celebrating a birthday or waiter gave us the also recommended butter cake on the house which was very nice and I think the dessert is not as good as they say. but we all enjoyed it overall the steak is what I will come back for it was such a great meal."}

We watched the guy make them, so we know they were not sitting for a while, but still yet, who likes a soggy bun? \\n\\nThe flavors of the peppers, pickle, tomato, onions, and green relish worked well together, the hot dog itself had a little snap to it, so I assume it was close to the real thing, however, I would try a different dog next time. As for the sides, the zucchini sticks were plentiful and had good crisp to them, but the chili on the fries did seem canned. \\n\\nFor a hot dog, this place was just okay.

Our server was a late 20' something that looked less than thrilled to see our water drinking selves. \\n\\nAnyways, ordered the Guacamole: $10 \\n\\nnot that it was bad or anything, but when we ran out of chips it took five minutes for the server to get to our table and an additional five mins to get the chips. Not super busy either... \\n\\nAfter this it was more of the same. I got the short ribs, which were supposed to be a specialty item. Now they were not bad, but I have had much and made much better. And they seemed a little dry. \\n\\nMy dad and brother got tacos that were good, but they ran out of tortillas and it took 10 minutes to get new ones.\\n\\nThe lady got fried chicken and it was a little dry,with grilled broccoli which was not received well by the Pharmacist. Anyways, my point is this....The server didn't see us as a phat tip and it showed via her lack of service. Over all food was ok, but the server ruined it."}

I saw the  Maitre D and smiled at him.  He had a blank look on his face.  The girls at the front were trying to get us seated and had called us to be seated prematurely.  So, right from the start I wasn't getting the old school Italian feel.  Once seated the waiter was on point.  The bus person was on it with water and refilling the glasses.  I ordered their famous Ossobuco.  It was good but not great as I was hoping.  However, the pasta and sauce was cooked excellently.  I enjoyed that more."}

They have a sign saying that they prefer cash, and that 'credit card and debit card fees break small businesses'. Huh? The first thing I ate here was shrimp fajitas, which with drink was about $15. Very small portions and not worth it. Chips are ok, but the salsa and picante sauce are in squirt bottles...and cold as heck. If you want any kind of side, it costs a dollar or more. I got a burrito the next time I came here (it was good, the Healthy Bean one) and it is 5.50, but if you want sour cream, guacamole, and chicken (they try to press it on you) that will be another nearly 5 bucks. It's good but not very big. Drinks are in small styrofoam cups and cost 2 bucks. They have a sign saying NO OUTSIDE DRINKS. I can see why, they have a racket going here on their overpriced drinks. The straw that broke the camel's back is that I waited in line behind two people who couldn't make up their mind for twenty minutes, and the woman behind the counter tried to help the woman BEHIND me first. WTF? Not great service, food is ok with skimpy portions, cheapo atmosphere, TIP JAR in your face...skip this place."}

The place is very cute and cool, tons of tv's with tons of sports to watch.  Nice and cool inside, and there wasn't many people when we went.  Our server was not good at all.  Kept forgetting about us.  Forgetting to bring us things, small or big, she couldn't get it together.  Now, just because I myself am a server and work in a restaurant doesn't mean I'm picking on her.  She herself said to me 'am I ignoring you guys alot tonight?' ummmmmmmmm yeah!!!!!!!!! \\n\\nThe little game area was ok, although the machines kept taking my money and I  had to keep getting someone to fix it.  Annoying!  \\n\\nFood was ok too.  Loved the house salad.  My pizza kinda sucked, was suppose to be thick crust and was thin.  We had to ask three times for more dressing.  My mom ordered a wheat beer and she was brought ??? well it wasnt  wheat beer, so she ordered something else.  Ten minutes later, still no beer.  I finally had to get up fine the server and ask her to get the beer........now!\\n\\nWe had fun just being together and watching the game and my son play.  But, I wont be going back anytime soon. :("}

We made sure to get there early to avoid the crowds.  The problem was that Mac Grille seems to schedule wait staff very thinly at the beginning of the evening. So our waitress was the hostess! She didn't know much past where to seat us but gave her all in the attempt until the overloaded waitress stopped by to take over.  Despite it, both the hostess and the waitress were very pleasant and professional throughout. Shame on Mac Grille for understaffing though.\\n\\nTo the food! Meh.\\n\\nMy wife had something called Carmela's Chicken. It was a nice looking bowl of rigatoni, chicken, mushrooms and other assorted goodies. She seemed to enjoy it but I found it to be fairly ordinary. As a guy who cooks professionally, I am always looking to be blown away with flavor or at the very least something that I didn't think to make at home. It could have used a little salt (especially in the pasta boiling water) to bring out the nice semolina taste in the noodles. The important thing is that she liked it and was happy.\\n\\nI got Mama's Combo. A plate with lasagna, chicken parm and a chicken and mushroom cannelloni. The cannelloni was pretty good the lasagna was the star of the plate but the chicken parm was a pure throw away. I was unaware of where on the chicken a round disc of breast meat comes from (probably right nest to the nugget!). If I was to bet my last dollar on something to regain my vast fortune I would place it on the fact that the chicken came straight out of a box, already breaded and cooked and flash heated and put on the angle hair. Very disappointed. Did really enjoy the lasagna bolognese, though.\\n\\nSo, who knows, maybe one day we go back, but honestly I don't think we will feel on our deathbeds that we missed out on anything special if we never stop by again. Shame.\\n\\nAlso, just FYI, they were out of 2 of the 4 tap beers walking into a Friday night! Who does that? May as well run out of parmesan cheese! Oh yeah speaking of parmesan cheese, I hate restaurants that have the server put the parm on your food in those grinders. Seems like if you like a lot of parm on your grub (like all of us) you are screwing it up for the other tables, so you allow them to leave too darned soon and you are left wanting more but felling a bit shy and embarrassed to ask them to come back and pile on some more. Just sayin.\\n\\nEat Well!!!!!!\\nV-Dub"}

He was rude, offensive and extremely condescending.  When we sat down we both put $100 into the machines, and began playing the max bet, which was a requirement we both fully understood and were fine with to be able to comp our drinks.  Josh reminded us when he brought the first round that we could have one drink every 30 minutes, and that we needed to be playing the max bet.  Again, we were fine with that and it was not an issue.\\n\\nWe started playing and were winning.  After about 35 minutes or so we ordered our second round of drinks and Josh, who was busy making shots and espresso martinis for the two couples next to us (of whom only one person was playing the video poker machine occasionally but all four persons were receiving comped drinks), seemed annoyed.  He reluctantly brought us the drinks and then continued to ignore us and boast an air of arrogance to all of those around him.\\n\\nFinally, after another 35-40 minutes had gone by, we asked Josh for a final round of drinks, and he rudely told us that he had to ask his floor manager because he didn't know if we had played enough.  His comment was absurd and delivered in such a way that we could not have been more offended.  He did not adhere to this policy with any of the other players around us, so why we were singled out when we had been consistently gambling and did not ask for drinks before we knew 30+ minutes had passed just baffled us.  We were merely killing time before taking a limo to the airport, so his behavior was just absurd.\\n\\nAfter checking with his floor manager who informed him that we had been gambling enough and another drink was approved, he decided to tell us that before he could give us another drink we had been warned by him, and that \\\"his job was on the line.\\\"  We were LIVID.  My husband offered to pay for the drinks, and we left right away to speak with management about the treatment we had just received.  Upon asking to speak to the manager we were told to walk back to the Bar and that he/she would be there to talk to; however, no one was to be found.  We don't know if it was by the hand of Josh that this person never appeared, but it leaves us to conclude that this particular bar and this particular bartender are some of the worst in not just Vegas, but the US.  \\n\\nWe are huge fans of the Aria and were extremely disappointed in this service experience and the way it was handled afterwards.  We will seriously consider other casinos and hotels to stay at during our next trip to Vegas, even though we loved the Sky Suite and every other person at the hotel besides Josh."}

I attribute that to the fact that the super deep fried pieces of chicken are completely soaked in sauce. For the Sweet & Sour, the addition of Sriracha helped add the \\\"sour\\\" to the sauce, but for the Orange...well lets just say I've had my fill of Orange Marmalade for a year. \\n\\nThe Hot & Spicy is really where this place shines. The chicken is perfectly cooked( lightly fried in chili oil) and topped off with vegetables and chilis. Goes great with the tableside spicy rice seasoning.\\n\\nAnd now, the price. For about 6 bucks, you get a huge meal, and wonderful service.

First off, I did like the decor, but the tables were somewhat close together, so this didn't provide much privacy for date night conversation... but alas, we were here for food... \\n\\nI left Eddies House somewhat confused and very underwhelmed. After such great reviews, I'm not sure why our experience was so much different. Maybe it was our waiters complete apathy for showing any kind of friendliness or excitement for what he is doing. Or maybe it was simply the food itself. We shared the shrimp appetizer, which was fine... maybe a bit too spicy for me and the dough balls had NO flavor and were hard as a rock. I ordered the meatloaf, as many people on yelp raved about it - I did think it was good, but nothing I would rave about. The Hubs had the sea bass and liked the lemon addition, but that was about it. After trying his I really felt it was way too salty and nothing too special. The half portions are really small, so beware. They were a good size for me, but the Hubs was left hungry after his. We got dessert, even though nothing really sounded great - had the cookie tiramisu, which was nice for an ice cream dessert (which I wasn't expecting it to be), but nothing special or memorable. \\n\\nI found it interesting that Eddie, the owner, said hello to every table but ours, as I was watching to see if he would.

When Julie K had posted a talk thread informing us of the Groupon Reserve, 2 for $99, I jumped on it figuring there wouldn't be better time to try it. Made a reservation for 10:30, arrived on time, and was seated an hour later. An hour. I guess they figure my time isn't valuable, I could've slept in longer! Finally we were seated but didn't have our drink ordered taken for another 10 minutes, as we were sitting there I was noticing the decor, I felt like I was in a Cosby Show episode, the ambiance was very strange. 80's theme all the way. Started out at the station with the broiled lobster tails, seemed to look good, they were split in half so I grabbed a couple, these were decent but nothing spectacular. I skipped the carving station as I'm not a huge meat eater so I can't comment on that. The entire warming station was set up like a catering type deal, all the food is in a metal flip top with fire under neath so all the food had that hardened layer on top. Not appetizing at all. Went over to the sushi station, ordered hamachi and tako, when I got to the table, I noticed how hard the fish was, I wasn't brave enough to try it. The caviar was scooped from a bucket type thing, I gave it a try but spit it out. It was so warm. I tried the oysters which were stacked on a plate sitting on ice, again when I returned to the table I noticed how smelly they were. So I was too nervous to try them. All the while we were barely checked on my our server, we had maybe 3 refills of PJ (that's basically the best part of the meal so far) we ended up eating mostly crab legs and a few crab claws. The desserts were comparable to Costco, we tried the creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e, ehh.

This is marginal food.\\n\\nThe steaks were about as good as you can find at any other steakhouse. Some of the sides, appetizers and salads were above average.

How wrong we were!  Last night we wanted to go out and have some good Wisconsin 'pub' food, but wanted to try someplace different.  After looking through reviews of numerous places on this site and others, I decided to give this place a try.  My family was a little skeptical at first, but once we entered fears began to ease.  The size, layout, decor and most importantly the food were all top notch for a pub.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was picayune, but important to me.  Last night was Friday which means Fish Fry in Wisconsin.  Of course this meant I had to partake in the all you can eat version of it!  While the initial plate was plentiful and reasonably prepared, it took FOREVER to arrive and no one ever asked if I wanted more.  I'm sure this was probably due to them being packed, but even so it did detract a little for me from my overall take on the place.  That being said, we are eagerly awaiting our next visit there!"}

{"_id": 2, "text": "I really wish I was writing a \\\"Hooray!\\\" but I'm not. The Uptown location wasn't my first rodeo with the Mushroom and won't be my last.  The Mushroom is usually solid artisan pizza, just not this time.  I started visiting different Mellow Mushrooms about ten years ago.  The Jerk pizza has always been my \\\"go-to.\\\"\\n\\nI went to the Uptown location for a business lunch.  Not too bad.  We got seated in less than a minute.  The menu didn't have my favorite, but I'm the type of person that is willing to try many different things.  So I asked our waitress for a recommendation and was led to the Mellowterranean.  A grilled chicken pizza with onions, roasted red peppers, black olives, chives, feta, mozzarella and tzatziki sauce.  Sounds like a homerun eh?\\n\\nTwo things to note about this pizza:\\n\\nGigantic roasted red pepper laid out on the pizza.  This isn't convenient to eat, and the texture and amount just make this strange and unappealing.\\n\\nSecond, yes, the tzatziki is pretty tasty, but I found myself using it to cover up the other tastes.  A condiment should compliment, not be needed to cover up the  the rest of the dish.\\n\\nLastly, the cheese bread appetizer.  Oh how I laughed.  The look on my associate's face was priceless.  To quote, \\\"Is this cheese on hot-dog buns?\\\"  Lol...I almost spit water out my nose when he said that.  To be fair, what we were brought, looked nothing...and I do mean...nothing...like the picture you see on Yelp.  Maybe they were out of bread and went with the old \\\"McGuyver that shit\\\" method...but \\\"hot-dog buns\\\" is being nice about it.\\n\\nSo why three stars if the whole experience was less than decent?  Because I know the Mellow Mushroom as a whole.  I know that this is the only experience I've had that was disappointing.  Maybe it was an off day, maybe it was blah blah blah.  Regardless of what it was, I'd go back and expect things to be a much better experience.  Would I recommend or order what I've had?  Not a chance, but I wouldn't exclude them from my list of pizza joints based on one bad experience either."}

The hostesses passed around finger foods that included fried lobster, crab cakes, beef in a blanket, chicken on a stick, and lady finger desserts. The food was great and the girls were friendly and not stuck up, which can really make or break the experience of wherever you are. The ambiance of the bar was an old timey, but modern and classy twist to it, definitely somewhere you'd want to spruce yourself up a bit when you're there. \\nThere is one downside to it, I wish that it was just a little bit bigger, it feels pretty cramped, although there is an outside section, it still feels like your are up in everyone's bubble.\\nI will most certainly be back to this place when I am in town again, the Linq is actually a really neat place to hang out after you get drinks at Blvd."}

Not here. Just wait in line, wasting away the day. It wouldn't bother me as much if I didn't see 20 or more employees walking around all over the store. \\n\\nEven with the long lines, this was the only store that sold Dill buttons. If you aren't someone that uses buttons that often, this means nothing. Dill makes high quality buttons for blazers and suits. Metal and plastic.

Side note, our waters had some of the largest ice cubes (actual cubes) that I had ever seen in my life - I was amazed. I was also pleasantly surprised by the speediness in which our food came out. \\n\\nThe chicken drumsticks were ingenious, each drumstick was trimmed down leaving the meat at the bottom of the bone almost creating a handle making it super easy to bite down without the mess. The plate was accompanied by a delicious sauce that I can only guess was a creamy ranch and a bowlful of fresh veggies. \\n\\nMy Greek salad was a complete work of art in multiple layers, so pretty but in the end a little hard to eat. The base layer of my salad featured hummus and then built upon that were romain lettuce spears, garbanzo beans, red and yellow tomato chunks, cucumbers, feta cheese triangles, croutons and topped off with shredded parmesan. The salad was drizzled with a lemon vinaigrette which I was most excited about however it was just a bit too sweet for my taste. As mentioned before it was difficult to cut into the spears without contents of my salad spilling onto the table so in the end I just picked up the spears with my hands and ate it that way, not a big deal but messy nonetheless. \\n\\nDuring my meal I noticed how attentive the wait staff was, constantly checking on our party and others in our area. At one point a manager even came over to introduce herself to us.

The sauce was the highlight, but Icon's kitchen was not very generous with it.  \\n\\nTwo diners left disappointed, not full at all, after four tapas and one drink each for $86.  \\n\\nIcon:  neither a good meal nor a good deal."}

{"_id": 2, "text": "*In cranky old person voice* - Buffets nowadays are getting more and more high-falutin', charging more and more for food that we can only look at longingly when our guts are full to the point of poppin!!\\n\\nFact - The d\\u00e9cor at Bacchanal is equal to that of Michelin-starred restaurants, a setting in which overpaying for your food seems to make sense.  There is no question this place is beautiful.\\nFact - The bounty is plentiful.  This is the stuff that could trigger sensory overload...think Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory but with more than just candy.  \\nFact - Their dim sum is better than most regular Chinese dim sum places I've been to in Orange County.  Sad to say but it's true!\\n\\nUnfortunately, the ultimate fact is...unless, you're some type of competitive eater (or secretly employ the use of a vomitorium like they used to do in the olden Bacchanal days), you're only eating 1/3 of what you're paying for the buffet.  Everything else is going to the cost of d\\u00e9cor and excess food.  \\\"Getting your money's worth\\\" is a purely subjective mission here.\\n\\nAs beautiful as the rest of the place was, hubby and I got shoved into what appeared to be an overflow room where our chairs didn't match and our table was no better than a two top in a French caf\\u00e9.\\n\\nFood was plentiful as I mentioned and nothing really stood out. It was definitely a shock and awe type feeling.\\n\\nMy biggest issue with this place was the service.  Our server was ok, not super attentive so we didn't get refills unless we craned our necks to flag him down.  The biggest offender, however, was the surly possibly racist jerk at the carving station.  I witnessed him being openly rude to a meek lady with limited English skills and then suddenly offering the next few Caucasian people the biggest brightest smiles and an almost subservient tone of voice.  When it was my turn, I was once again shocked at his brusqueness and his rude tone of voice.  I smiled/chuckled and asked him if he actually gave away the entire ribeye to which his reply was an icy glare accompanied with \\\"No, you can't have the whole steak.\\\" I ended up with the worst, fattiest cut he could scrounge up for me.  My next visit to his station was wordless even when I attempted some banter.  I'm typically a \\\"live and let live\\\" type of person but if I ever run into this guy again, I believe will call him out on his rudeness.  A subsequent courtesy email to Caesar's customer service received no response.\\n\\nAs other Yelpers have noted, it's more expensive than typical buffets out there.  It just depends on whether you think you're willing to pay for d\\u00e9cor and maybe slightly better tasting food.  I'm still down with Wicked Spoon...."}

Or maybe nobody gave them enough time to get some great nail techs and get settled in after opening their first store. If you haven't been back lately, I encourage you to give them another chance.\\n\\nSure, we almost broke up once about 3 years ago. I had been seeing a girl I loved - Brittany - then she left and went to open the Cardiff location. I felt lost, even went to Cardiff once while in San Diego to get my nails done by her again. Finally, I found a great replacement. Then SHE left and I was stuck with someone I didn't know. It was the worst manicure I had ever gotten and I called to cancel my 20 Lounge membership.\\n\\nI got a call back from the manager Debbie. I was a shellac fiend. She convinced me to come in and see her and let her give me a replacement gel manicure. I surely wasn't going to survive without redoing the manicure immediately so I gave her one last shot.\\n\\nI've found my new love. I've been seeing Debbie now for almost 2 years and I absolutely ADORE her. She does the most amazing gel and it lasts me 3-4 weeks. She knows when I travel we need to go shorter in length, summer is French, and winter she surprises me with fun colors or glitter fades. Plus, she's a blast to talk to and I want to talk to her!!! She's positive, beautiful inside and out, and it's like therapy and a mani/pedi all in one!\\n\\nThe place is so clean. It's beautiful. It's priced appropriately.

Sure it's a little different and awkward to stick your feet in a bowl vs. the massage chairs with bubbling hot water... BUT... my argument on this is that at least they aren't using a dremel to remove the gel and ruining your nail!!!! And there is no way they are going to recommend you need an eyebrow wax while you're trying to relax (HELLO!)\\n\\nI'll end by saying this: If you purchased a Groupon and live in Glendale, don't bother.

{"_id": 3, "text": "I tried Mercurio's gelato two years ago and, more recently, at the Yelp Burgh Bash this past Sept., and I finally had the chance to stop by for dinner last Sat.  Based on my experience with the gelato and what I'd heard from Yelp and elsewhere, I was eager to try Mercurio's savory offerings.\\n\\nMy dining partner and I shared a house salad (insalata de la casa), as well as a prosciutto pizza.  (Thanks for the great recommendation, fellow Yelpers!)  The house salad consisted of spring greens, tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and parmesan dressed with balsamic vinaigrette dressing, and included two pieces of toasted Italian bread.  I found the salad to be quite fresh and flavorful, and large enough for two people to share comfortably.  In terms of flavor, I found the pizza to be quite solid, with the prosciutto being the standout, with just the right amount of smokiness and saltiness.  It also hid a few key shortcomings, such as a sparser-than-preferable amount of cheese, quite effectively.  If you've read my reviews of other pizza places around PGH, you'll know that the aspect of pizza that I tend to be persnickety about is the crispness of the crust. While the crust was light and airy, which was great, it unfortunately lacked the key crispness on the bottom that's essential to a perfect pizza, in my view.  Nevertheless, I was generally pretty satisfied with the quality of the pizza, esp. compared to other wood-fired pizza places around town.\\n\\nNeedless to say, after finishing the savory portion of our meal, my dining partner and I had to order the gelato, since that's what Mercurio's is best known for.  I had a small, which I split between mint chocolate chunk (my favorite!) and triple chocolate, and my dining partner had a medium, split between chocolate and caramel.  The gelato was just as delectable as I remembered, with satisfying creaminess and flavors.\\n\\nWhile the ambiance was a bit minimalist, I didn't mind. My one complaint about the layout was that the dining area was quite small and could feel a bit cramped at times.  (At one point, we had to move our table over a bit so that our neighbors could squeeze through.)  I found the service to be a slower than I'd like, but this was probably due to there being only one waitress responsible for serving all of the dining tables.  Even one more waiter probably would have sped things up and reduced the stress on her significantly.  Overall, despite a couple of shortcomings, I had a pleasant experience dining at Mercurio's, and would definitely return."}

{"_id": 3, "text": "Visiting Penang for the first time this past weekend, and I have to say this is probably one of the most authentic Malaysian cuisines I've tried in the West Coast.  I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and I've practically tried every Malaysian/Singaporean restaurants/cafes in the Bay Area.  This restaurant outclass all of these wannabe's including the ultra-pretencious (and unreasonably expensive) Straits Cafe.\\n\\nI normally go to Satay Malaysian Grille when I am in Vegas...i thought their satay was really good, until I tried Penang this trip.  I went they twice in a row this trip, ordering their Hainanese Chicken rice (excellent!) and chicken satay (even better than Satay Malaysian Grille, esp. the satay sauce).  Also ordered the Cantonese Style Seafood Chow Fun, which is quite good, but frankly, the one at Satay Malaysian Grille is a tad better.\\n\\nOverall, both Satay Malaysian Grille and Penang Malaysian are very very good... far better than any of the so-called Malaysian/Singaporean places in the Bay Area (with the exception of Rasa, located near the San Jose International Airport).  Penang Malaysian edges ahead in terms of authenticity and price point (about 10-20% cheaper than Satay Malaysian).  Sadly, the business at Penang is nowhere close to its arch rival, which is also on Spring Mountain Road, probably due to the fact that it's a much further away from the strip, hidden in a local Asian strip mall.  In my opinion, \\\"da-best\\\" Malaysian restaurant/cafe is still the Nyonya in NY's Chinatown!  That's a absolutely 5-star rating!"}

Bad wine is unacceptable for any restaurant, especially when wine can play such an important role in the meal.\\n\\nDessert was great, but I only know because I stole a bite from Catherine's plate.

Also, a promoter outside the hotel informed us that they were having a Michael Jackson tribute that night, and who doesn't love a little MJ? But I will get back to those promoters in a minute... We had put ourselves on the guest list, and as soon as we went and asked a bouncer, we got in almost instantly.  \\n\\nWe had a really good time that night - The Michael Jackson impersonator was actually very good! Sang, danced & he even looked a lot like him! He performed several sets in between the regular music, and it was highly entertaining. Good job Prive! \\n\\nThere was also some random guy there dressed like Mr. T and I just had to get a picture with this man! hahaha With that being said, the crowd here admittedly, was a little more ghetto than your major clubs such as XS, Tao or Tryst. They definitely play way more hip hop here than anything else, but that's OK with me - Fun to dance to & sing along with. They even played the Vegas version of \\\"I'm in Miami Bitch,\\\" by replacing the word 'Miami' with 'Las Vegas.' The whole crowd sings along.. It's a great time :)\\n\\nBut be forewarned about the so-called \\\"club promoters\\\" outside. On this last trip to Vegas, we stayed at the Planet Hollywood hotel for a full 7 nights. There was not one day where we were not approached and given \\\"VIP access\\\" wrist bands. EVERY SINGLE DAY. And they were giving them to everyone. So how VIP is that, really? I mean, I know all clubs hand out passes and whatnot, but every day the promoter & the story would change. Sometimes, they told us that these bracelets let us skip the line. Other times, it was free cover, or free drinks for ladies.... Every single thing you can think of came out of their mouths, and none of it was true. The wrist band will get you a whole lot of nothing - Just do yourself a favor and get on guest list. That will at least get you in with no wait and way reduces your cover charges. I'm glad we did.\\n\\nHowever, I was disappointed by one thing - I had read in several places that Prive holds a weekly event on Mondays called \\\"Money for Nothing\\\" Mondays, in which they drop $5,000 cash onto the dance floor. This definitely did not happen - and we stayed til almost close. Maybe it was because they had the special event with the Michael Jackson impersonator there that night, and so it wasn't their normal industry night, but that was one of the main reasons we thought this would be a fun club to go to. Allthough, I did recently read that they are going bankrupt and may close soon, so that may also be another reason they didn't do it. I'm not sure. But in either case, I was a little let down. \\n\\nAlso, if you like watching eye candy, jaw-dropping hot go go dancers, Prive is not the club for you. There were absolutely no real dancers! Girls were allowed to get up and dance in the spots where the dancers SHOULD have been, but let's be honest - Your average girl at Prive is not the same as a professional go go dancer. \\n\\nOverall, we had a really good time that night, but I just don't think we'll be going back. I'd rather spend my time at Tao or Tryst."}

(I work in the restaurant biz so I have grown some patience) anyway, the host was looking for MARK party of 3, no one was responding so I asked her if she meant MARLI. She said I will check. She never got back to us so we waited a little longer, after 30 min of waited I decided to ask her how much longer, she asked for me name and she responded \\\" I don't have you on my list\\\" I laughed at her and said oh maybe I was your mark party. She looked back at her list and said oh I could t read my writing. She apologized and she kindly said we will sit you right away.\\n\\nWe got seated and walked up the a dirty table with fries all of the floor and food still on the seats. The male who Sat us said I am sorry we will clean it right now we are just busy. I was disgusted.\\n\\nI will never go back to this location."}

Something about it didn't feel right... the bathrooms (had nice finishes, but not too terribly clean).  Maybe I just caught them on an \\\"off\\\" day, but an untidy theater is really off-putting to me.\\n\\nThe movie was over all was fine... the seats left something to be desired.  Stadium seating, but narrow rows so if you have some neighbors with small bladders like I did, your feet got a steping on.  I think I may just be spoiled with the trendy theaters around town that serve alcohol and food to you while you watch, but would I go out of my way to watch a movie here?  Probably not..."}

If you are a short-timer to the Midwest on a temporary academic layover in CU, a trip up to Prairie Fruits Farm (10 min north of CU) is a great way to learn to love the town before you move on to bigger and different places.\\n\\nTheir cheeses are excellent, and I have to believe that in 3 years of steady patronage I've tried them all. If you see them at the farmer's market in Urbana (aka Market at the Square) they will usually have a selection of 3-5 to choose from with samples. By 10:30, when I usually roll by, their pickens are a lil slimmer, but as I said, you really can't go wrong w/ any of their goat and sheep cheeses. \\n\\nThey host several bi-weekly \\\"Dinners at the Farm\\\" on Sunday evenings and weekly Saturday breakfasts (when Market at the Square is off-season). These aren't cheap,with the dinners at $75 a diner, and you BYOBing, but they are well worth it. The farm employs a gourmet chef who takes local food from their farm, Blue Moon Farm, Tommanhous(sp?) farm, Tiny Greens, and other local farmers and crafts tremendous multi-course meals. In between courses there is time to tour the farm and its many cool things to check out- I'll leave them for you to discover, but take my word you wont be disappointed. \\n\\nThe 'politics' of this local/organic/simple foods concept that proprietors Leslie Cooperbrand and Wes Jarrell champion jibes with my personal view of what producers and consumers of food should pursue. This is of course just my view, but even if it is not yours, it should not interfere with you enjoying the ever-loving shit out of their top-notch noms. \\n\\nNo trip to the farm is complete without meeting 'the girls'. Goats are just awesome. Baby goats are even better. If that is news to you, take the opportunity of a trip to the farm and see if I'm wrong. BTW just for funsies: A compatriot, who shall remain nameless, asked the vendor whether the goat pictured in a photo made the cheese. The response: \\\"No, we make the cheese. The goats make the milk.\\\""}

The toilet had a door but had no fan or light switches from inside.

They've got a nice selection of mixed drinks and beer, and I loved the green chili queso.  I thought this place was packed when we got there, but when we left the line out the door was even longer!  Despite how busy they were, the line did move at a fairly good pace.  And you walk by the bar so you can order a drink while you're waiting in line.  To continue with what was good about this place, after we were seated with our food, our server came around frequently to refill drinks and such.  Also, being as I was pregnant and couldn't indulge in one of the delicious-looking cocktails, I indulged in a Raspberry White Chocolate shake... mmm.\\n\\nThe \\\"cons\\\" I had are more \\\"FYI\\\" as they don't reflect poorly on the restaurant itself.  It's more of a \\\"know your venue\\\" type of thing.  Tip #1: This place is not the best for large groups, especially during busy times (a fact they even warn you about on their website).  It's just not set up for it.  We had a group of 8 of us, and did actually manage to get tables next to each other, but that was pretty lucky and it was still hard to have a conversation with anyone other than those at your immediate table (the tables don't push together so each table is spaced apart from the others).  Tip #2: This place is not toddler-friendly.  Or even really kid-friendly.  For several reasons.  First, you have to stand in line to order (which can be a long line if they're busy).  Never fun to stand in a narrow, crowded line with a toddler.  Second, they have no kids menu.  Not that your kids can't eat off the adult menu, but the burgers are a little pricey to get one just for your kid.  Come prepared to share, I guess.  And third, there's no real seating for kids.  Tables are high up, and not set up for either high chairs or booster seats.  Possibly the tables outside could work with a high chair, if they even have them (I didn't ask, since there was no point with our indoor tables.  I mean, those tables were tall!)\\n\\nAgain, I want to re-iterate that those things are not \\\"bad\\\" things!  I mean, they were unfortunate for me and my large party with toddlers, but that's our fault for not picking a more family-friendly restaurant, and not Hopdoddy's fault.  If you're a couple with a young baby, or a family with older children, great!  Bring your kiddos!  But if you've got a large group or small children, be forewarned."}

We were seated right away but from then on the service was horrendous. We waited for our drinks for 30 min before our waitress came by to take a order. Our orders were taken but then it took over ONE HOUR for our food to arrive. During this time no one came over to explain the delay or check up on us. The food arrived sporadically, so that by the time the last person's food arrived (a full HOUR AND A HALF after we arrived) the first few people were done eating. There was only two waitresses working the place, which was fine, but only one of them was actually waitressing, the other one was just standing behind the tea bar, cleaning and organizing stuff. Hello! If we are just waiting for 1.5h for stuff, at least you could come by and offer us to order drinks or something. She didn't even care! After our meal I went up to her on behalf of our group and asked to speak to the manager. She said \\\"the manager is in the back, is there an issue I can help you with?\\\" and I explained our frustration at the lack of service and waiting forever for our food and she actually argued with me! She said \\\"actually, we checked the tickets and it only took half an hour from the time you ordered till the food arrived.\\\" Sorry, but maybe that's because it took forever to order our food, and it was MAYBE a half hour until the first person in the group got their food, the last person didn't get theirs till 3:45pm.  And besides, why would you even argue that with me? Even half an hour is too long to wait for a SANDWICH! And why don't you just get the manager?! She went on to say that the manager was also the cook in the back, and the only one at that. Whatever, then at least let us know that before we waste forever at your place, or offer us some tea or coffee while we wait, it's not like you're THAT busy.  The one time I actually did need something (I got coffee as my drink, but there was no milk and sugar given with it) I actually waited so long that I eventually GOT UP and approached the waitress to ask her to hand it to me before I the coffee got cold. Anyway, the whole attitude was just snobby and I didn't like it. I would recommend NOT to go to this place!"}

Well, like hundreds of patrons, we were in line at 1 of 7 kiosks well before 5:45 but due to the long lines the drum closed and our entries never got in.  what a lousy way to do business.  A simple solution - 1) post times at the players club so accurate information is available 24/7 as the club closes 2) allow anyone in line by the cut off time to enter a drawing and postpone the winning announcement until all entries are in!  3) set up digital displays with winning numbers - the announcer held the microphone so close to his mouth no one could understand the numbers being called - ask anyone they will all agree.  I used to like this place but this March contest has shown me the lack of good customer service.  one supervisor actually said it is not their responsibility to make sure my entries make it in - that is on me.  well, miss cocky - it should be your concern to have ample kiosks to handle the crowds for special drawing dates - or - use common sense and have the drawing time delayed until entries are in the drum!  not another cent of mine will be spent n their gaming, restaurants, concerts, coffee shop.

It soon became clear why this was the case.\\n  \\nOur waitress came to the table once, after we sat there for about 20 minutes.

One couple had ordered a sushi roll, which also had not been delivered so they cancelled that.\\n\\nThe food was not particularly good.  The filets were all cooked to medium well, no matter how they were ordered.  On the other hand, the shrimp did not seem to be cooked all the way.  There were even items missing like a chicken breast, so the chef had to cook those at the very end. \\n\\nSince our waitress had not come back, we had to ask another person to refill the waters.

They have a motto saying that they have \\\"the biggest and best sandwiches\\\", but what you get is exactly the opposite.

First problem on this Saturday was the cashier girl, who was new and did not know the answers to any questions we asked about the food. Who trained this individual? The next issue was the sandwich itself, but these 8 buck Wedge sandwiches are small, constructed poorly and somehow, the condiments of mayo, lettuce and tomato caused me alot of gas only 45 minutes later.

I don't have my qualms with bad Mexican food, hell I eat at Taco Bell at least once a month and that is about as shitty as it gets but when I go to a sit down Mexican restaurant I expect a higher standard. Now, don't get me wrong 3 Amigos was not Taco Bell quality, it was higher quality food but prepared hastily served by an unhappy waiter who was practically chewing his nails to get out of work. \\n\\n When walking into the faux-fiesta lit restaurant I really wanted to enjoy myself but the poor quality food and lack-luster waiter who paid most attention to us when it came time to tip than he did the rest of the evening, did not meet my standards for a good dining experience. The waiter unfortunately was moody the whole time he was serving us but I chose to ignore the fact and plot my revenge later on Yelp. I ordered sangria which was more water than wine and an enchilada that was served with poor cuts of chicken breast topped in a very dismal green sauce. I wanted kick and spice, hadn't any of these people seen Speedy Gonzalez? Mexican food should always strive to get that kind of reaction out of people. Perhaps the Canadians are too far away from Mexico to understand the treats of a quality enchilada but I was less than impressed with the dish (If you wanted a witty remark like \\\"Fiesta? More like Siesta!\\\" unfortunately you won't find it here). \\n\\n In the end the price was definitely not worth it. St. Denis is a large street with many options, you want good booze? Try the Microbrewery, Les 3 Brasseurs, across the street. You want ethnic food? Try Zyng right up the block. Both will do food and booze much more justice than this place.

Yeah, I ended up dropping over $100 per person but I knew it was going to be expensive anyways so come with a fat wallet if you want to eat here.  I remember the Black Cod melting in my mouth and the exotic trout which shocked my tongue in a good way.  The Kobe beef was heavenly...  Just thinking about this meal has me wondering when I'll be in Vegas again.  Just don't order the regular sushi though, I heard it's good but it's probably something you can get at any decent sushi joint that you live near.  You have to get the \\\"special\\\" menu items."}

{"_id": 0, "text": "Been meaning to try this place for years and finally had an opportunity. Unfortunately it was a huge let down. The first bad sign was that upon walking in every table table that wasn't occupied had not been cleared from the previous diners. During the 1 1/2 hrs (!!!) that we were here there were several tables that NEVER got cleared. It took 20 minutes to get our drinks and another 45+ minutes until we received our food which was strange as no one else in the restaurant seemed to be ordering any food. There was a hair in the fish and chips (disgusting but mistakes happen), and the rest of the food was sub par at best. \\n\\nHaving lived half my life in England  I've been to plenty of pubs and also eaten plenty of mediocre pub food (none to my recollection as tasteless as this). However I would imagine that if you're trying to emulate a British Pub across the pond you would only want to bring over the best of the best, not the worst of the worst. Even the sad little mini frozen sausage rolls I had as a child were better. I'm a bit horrified that this is the \\\"taste of England\\\" that is being imposed on unsuspecting Arizonians who don't know any better. \\n\\nI guess if you're just looking to knock back a pint or two and play pool and would only ever order food under the most drunk and dire of circumstances then you may enjoy this version of a pub. There certainly were a lot of regulars (not ordering food...). \\n\\nP.S. I don't know if that greasy little man was a busser or a patron. If he was a patron he had no business going into the kitchen as many times as he did, or eating on the floor. If he was a busser then it would have been nice to see him clear more than one table he did. And I most certainly hope it was not his stringy long hair that we found in the fish and chips, although I wouldn't be surprised."}

The omelet came w/ spinach, cherry tomatoes, feta, and a side of pumpernickel bread.  The dish was just okay.  Maybe it was too healthy, as there was little flavor present.  Maybe they cook it with a spray and not butter.  Who knows...

A good amount of time passed before our server even popped up. We placed our orders and she dropped off some jam and butter shortly after. What was missing was the bread. I'm also not sure why we didn't have bread plates because I've always had them on my table on prior visits. Our bread came way later and just a bit before our entrees. My chicken and waffles were great as usual (they've changed it a bit since my last time ordering them. They add bacon and chives to the waffles now). But back to my main point, water glasses would sit empty for a good amount of time before being refilled. It was hard to catch someone's eye to get their attention. We sat around waiting to grab someone's attention just to get a box. I'm not sure if service would have been different inside, but it was extremely lacking at this location compared to my previous visit about a year and a half ago (or to their other locations for that matter).\\n\\nI'll have to give them another chance since I seriously adore their food if I'm in Vegas again, but for now, I'm sticking with the Bouchon in BH for my weekend brunches.\\n\\nNote: They do not take reservations for brunch at this location either."}

{"_id": 2, "text": "I really wanted to see \\\"How To Train Your Dragon II\\\" and the iPic didn't have a showing. Wanting a similar experience, my husband and I decided to try Studio Movie Grill. Since I had never been to SMG previously, I had to rely on Yelp reviews in determining the best seats. After my decision was made, I went online and ordered tickets the day before. When I made my purchase, it appeared that only two other seats that were taken. I was under the assumption that the theater would be dead.\\n\\nWhen we arrived the day of the show that was the complete opposite. The parking lot, the entrance, and the actual theater were bustling. Families were waiting in the lobby, eating food, and having a good time. Inside the theater, we found our seats and found ourselves trapped between two different families and their children. (Yes, I realize we went to see what is generally thought of as a \\\"kid's movie\\\".)\\n\\nAs the previews played, my husband looked at the menu and decided on ordering food. When no waiter came by to take our order, he pressed the red button and within 5 minutes a waiter showed up. We both ordered water and my husband ordered the coconut chicken/shrimp lunch option. Our waters arrived just as the movie had begun playing and about 15 minutes into the movie the food arrived. \\nThe food was okay - nothing special. Average French fries - some were crispy other were limp. The chicken was okay and I didn't try the shrimp. My husband agreed everything was just okay. When we were finished, the dishes sat a while before a waiter came by with the check and took away the dishes. \\n\\nOverall, SMG pales in comparison to the iPic on all fronts. Yes, it is a slight upgrade from \\\"regular\\\" theaters and it's nice you can order food instead of the standard popcorn and such. However, they have this funky setup inside the theater. The rows alternate between two distinctly different types of seating. One row is an elongated desk with office chairs (literally office chairs). The next row contains seats that have trays that swivel in front and to the side. (The material is similar to the leather of office chairs as well.) These chairs did not lean back and were a little disappointing. Needless to say, we did not sit at the desk/office chair row and I didn't see any other folks sitting there as well. I think SMG needs to rethink this and replace those rows with more comfortable seating.\\n\\nThe only other thing this place has going for it is the location. It's relatively close to my work/home and has ample parking. Plus, there are several over restaurants nearby in case you are hungry before/after a show. \\n\\nI can't say I will definitely be back but it's an option. I like having options."}

So when my friend decided on this place for the dinner before her bachelorette party, I knew exactly what to expect.\\n\\nWe had made a reservation, so they were prepared to accommodate our large group. What they weren't prepared for was how their other customers would feel. They decided to place us next to the railing inside the mall, and while the majority of our group tried to stick to general restaurant etiquette, some of us failed. Those of us that were did a LOT of apologizing to the tables around us. I feel like Kona should have placed us in a more private location, being that we forewarned them that we were a bach party.\\n\\nOur waiter didn't help the situation either. While he did cater to our ladies shots requests, encouraging things like sake bombs, he was also very sarcastic and rude when it came to everything else. He made a lot of off color jokes and comments about our get ups that weren't \\\"ha ha\\\", but more of \\\"you're all morons\\\". Here's a tip buddy: don't talk down to your customers. Especially ones that are likely going to be your biggest tip of the night. Our less than appropriate waiter had a younger female waitress helping him w/ orders and food delivery. She was awesome. She did her best to make sure everyone tabs were correct and fixed a few order issues that her counterpart had no interest in remedying. Such as asking the bartender for ginger beer for our one lady who foregoes booze. He scoffed at her and went to the next person to order. While our female savor went straight to the bar and brought back the ginger beer w/ an apology and promise that none of her \\\"beers' would appear on our check.\\n\\nThe food was really good (this is what I knew to expect). Most of the ladies went between pizzas and sushi, both were enjoyed. Their updated drink menu was very good. We very much enjoyed that you could actually see what the drinks looked like on the iPads that served as drink menus. Some table faves included: raspberry crush, strawberry basil lemonade, pineapple honey mojito, and the strawberry fizz.\\n\\nAll in all, our experience was good, mainly due to the menu and our female waitress (I WISH I could remember her name).

Also, the guacamole had a lot of additional ingredients:  peppers, onion, tomato, radishes, etc.  It was fantastic as well.\\n\\nFor lunch, I had the wagyu fajitas.  These were EXCELLENT and for $20 you get quite a lot of food.  The steak is heavily - but not overly so - seasoned, as are the accompanying onions and peppers.  You also get rice and beans, it's more than enough to make 3 good sized fajitas.  We also had the shrimp tacos, which are a staple for us at Mundo.  3 tacos in smaller size tortillas, they fill them to the brim, to the point you will probably have to resort to a fork at times.  They are crispy and flavorful, which is why one of us typically gets them.\\n\\nToday, we shared the street corn, which is taken off the cob and mixed with cojita cheese, crema, and spices.  It was excellent, better than many creamed corn dishes I've had at fancy steakhouses.  This side dish is a must, the corn is firm and retains a lot of its crunch.  The cheese is noticeable, and the spices add flavor without overwhelming.  Can't believe I haven't eaten this before.\\n\\nAlso, none of our drinks got close to empty.  Excellent service throughout.

{"_id": 2, "text": "Ok here's the deal. I went to pizzeria bianco this past week and bar bianco, so when we headed out to try Lux this morning, I figured, why not wait around and try Pane Bianco too. So that's what the BF and I did. Right when the restaurant opened I went in intending to only order one sandwich for the BF and I to share, but once inside, I saw they had a special focaccia and decided to get that too so we could have a more broad idea of what the food is like at this place. Both the sandwich and focaccia had mozz, basil, and tomato. So I went up and ordered and the man taking the orders was less than super friendly, but I can understand that for a place trying to be fast that is also super busy. Then I stepped to the side to pay with some other guy, who was actually pretty nice. After that, you have to sit around and wait for your food.... this is kind of awkward because the space is very small and warm and there are products all around so no matter where I stood I felt like I was in someone's way. Finally, they called my name and I got a little paper bag with my food in it and went to sit outside. The BF and I started by splitting the sandwich. Ok, so the sandwich was alright, I liked how the ingredients tasted fresh and the bread was very good, but it really could use something to make it a little more interesting. If they were to drizzle a little bit of aged balsamic on the sandwich, it would be delicious and I would want to come back for it all the time. As is.... I thought it was a little boring and would be kind of easy to make at home, so why would I come here for it? So after we finished that, we moved on to the focaccia. \\n\\nNow this was a different story. The focaccia was really good. It's like a corner slice of a square pizza almost. It had the same ingredients as the sandwich, but somehow tasted way better. I guess it's the melted cheese, the type of bread, and the fact that there was clearly olive oil on it that helped it be so much more flavorful. This was close to as good as the pizza was that we got at pizzeria bianco the other day. So, that made me happy and it only cost $4.50, so that made me even happier. I would be much more likely to come here than to wait three hours for the other. \\n\\nSo why does this place get 3 stars and the other get 4? I thought the selection here was very limited, which is fine if it helps them put out more quality food, but man, there's not a lot of choice. Also, the service was much better at the pizzeria. Finally, the appetizers at the pizzeria were freakin amazing and nothing I got today was amazing. HOWEVER I would probably come here again before going back to the pizzeria due to wait time.\\n\\nPS I didn't get a sweet! Now I feel sad. :-("}

I frequent new and old establishments.\\nI eat mom and pop all the way to joel robuchon.\\nI give everyone a fair chance, and probably me being in the industry is not going to help this review at all, however...\\n\\nUpon entering Firefly last night, there was no greeter for 4 minutes in a small lobby area that had no one present but myself and my girlfriend.\\nWhen the hostess finally sat us, we waited 10 minutes before anyone remotely attended to us. When that person came, it was for bread on the table. Then....the wait, another 10 minutes and still no service,even for drinks.\\nWhen my girlfriend spoke up, it was to another server who took our drink order AND our tapas selections. He told us, this was not his section, however..he put the order in and informed us that our \\\"server\\\" would be taking us through the remainder of our meal.\\nWe Thanked him and soon after, our plates arrived, rather quickly I might add.\\nI must say, I am glad we only ordered 5 plates. Everything was either a fried element or had some sort of fried item in the food. \\nAt best, it was \\\"ok\\\". \\n\\nThe Thai beef Salad tasted boring. No real essence of Thai at all. The beef almost tasted poached with no char,which could be from the over saturation of dressing. The dressing itself needed something to balance the acidity,perhaps a sweetness [which I am assuming was the purpose of the pickled ginger, is that even really \\\"Thai\\\"]\\nAnd the crispy wonton was over exposed and just way to much.\\n\\nThe empanada ..all I can say is Shame On You! Creme Cheese? Really?\\n\\nThe duck rolls were constructed as if it were rillette , almost a puree.\\nIf, and I do stress, it was supposed to be that way, I would suggest learning to confit.\\n\\nThe croquette seemed like fried potato soup with cheese. No real evidence of any ham whatsoever.\\n\\nAbout the only thing really \\\"decent\\\" was the tempura. Sauce was nice and not to overpowering with citrus segments in it. However, the green onions were left to soak in the grease for way to long and almost tasted burnt.\\n\\nAll the while of eating, I noticed the heavier set man who I am assuming is the FOH manager roaming. He spent most of his time however at a table, picking up a child and speaking to one table and that table alone. Not realizing what his staff is doing.\\n\\nNow, back to the lack of service. Our waiter who \\\"should\\\" have been giving us service in the first place finally arrived at plate number 4.\\nHe saw that most of the plates were left un eaten and suggested that he \\\"pack\\\" the food up in a to go box. We declined. He never asked us how our meal was or even why there was an abundance of food left.\\nYou would think someone would get 2 + 2.\\n\\nIt was also a little strange that when the \\\"original\\\" order taker asked if my girlfriend wanted a refill on her drink and the busboy delivered it, he prepared to take my beer away in replace,yet, my girlfriends glass was empty [ o , did I mention that I never received the option for a beer glass and just received a bottle], then..the bussboy brought another drink to the table after that. Two drinks in a confusing fashion were delivered. At this point, I was at my limit.\\n\\nThere are smaller points I could make, but I believe I am getting my point across. \\nFirefly, this is my second visit. I wont be returning for a long long long time, if ever."}

{"_id": 1, "text": "Not so sure what all the hype is about in the reviews here. My take on Tennessee Grill is sub par. Wife had the Ruben which was average at best. She had the onion rings an again average at best. As for myself I read the reviews on the pulled pork on a pretzel bun an that seemed liked like a sure thing. Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed. The bun an pork was ok but the sweet BBQ sauce was quite possibly the worst I've tasted. It did come with A spicy BBQ that was better flavor wise however it was way too spicy to enjoy. I ended up eating the sandwich with store bought BBQ sauce from the fridge. BTW the pulled pork across the highway at Q2U BBQ is in a whole different league. If you haven't tried it you need to!! I had it with sweet potato fries that were over cooked. We also got a side of potato salad. I read someone's review that the potatoes were not cooked all the way but didn't think that would happen again an to my surprise they were 1/2 cooked an 1/2 uncooked. Not sure how this happens in one batch when all were cut about the same size. Flavor was good but 1/2 cooked potatoes isn't very appealing. The thing the really drops this establishment down for me is the very small portion sizes, for the prices they're charging I expected better food quality an larger portions. I personally think the over achieving reviews stem from the very poor food  the restaurants in Anthem out out so this actually may seem good in comparison but for myself I for sure will not be returning for lunch or dinner. I'd like to try breakfast but in afraid id only be more disappointed."}

My nose did not enjoy it much! right when u walk into the room, to the right side is a half bathroom, then its the living room area, which is a nice size, then to the right is the bedroom and bathroom. The room was clean. the TV in the room sucked. it was like them ol skool TV's where it was huge in the back part. I liked the bathroom, it was nice and clean and big. there was a small TV in the bathroom which was cute. the bed was VERY comfy but the pillow sucked. It was too thick and it made my neck hurt.

They are guyanese, which is one of my favorite caribbean versions; I grew up with many guyanese friends and know the flavor profile well.  \\nWe stopped in for lunch - place was empty.  Perhaps a dinner might be better; I got the sense that they were still prepping for the evening, so lunch is whatever they have on hand.  They were out of curried goat.  They didn't have enough of the oxtail to make up my meal, so they gave me what they had and added some stewed chicken.  The beef patties were commercially bought ones - very disappointing.  I'd hoped they made their own here.\\nOverall, flavors were average.  The sparse caribbean restaurant options in Phoenix gives this place a pass on the flavors - it's better than not having any, but nothing to write home about (at least not the lunch I had).\\nThe owners are friendly, and the place is relatively clean (tables a bit sticky, however).  \\nI really want to like them, so I'll give them another try - this time a dinner when I'm in the neighborhood.

The review below it is for the location at New York New York\\n\\nPros:\\n* It's very convenient if you're staying at the Bellagio. Obviously.\\n* The car took us where we wanted to go without any mechanical problems.\\n\\nCons:\\n* The office is small, and, \\\"for customer privacy,\\\" you have to wait outside, in the heat, on a small bench, if another customer is inside. I have never before seen such a concern for privacy outside of a doctor's office, but you'll be in a bad mood by the time you finally enter.\\n* You'll pay a change fee of $10 or $11, even if it's to extend your reservation for another day, as we did. So you're punishing me for giving you MORE business?\\n* The office closes at 5, and the last time you can return the car is at 4:30. And there's no key drop after hours. So that means that you have to get up early and stumble down to the office to return your keys, or pay for an extra day. \\n* The car had smears of what looked like dried, sticky chocolate ice cream in the driver's side door pull and in the cup holders in the center console.\\n\\nIn New York, where I live, car rental companies can treat us like crap and we're used to it. (I don't own a car and rent from my neighborhood Dollar occasionally, but at least their agents are friendly while they gouge us.) Out here, I expect better. Next time, I'll rent at the airport (probably cheaper anyway), and certainly NOT from Dollar. In fact, I'm so pissed off that I may stop using them, regardless of location."}

Total hole in the wall on East Wash in a strip mall behind some Mexican buffet, with the name People's Bakery, you'd never guess this place would have the best Middle Eastern food in Madison.  \\n\\nStart with the wife of the wife and husband team, who greets you warmly as you come in.  The menu is on the wall, but there are hard copies for those who need an explanation of the nicely blended mix of Lebanese, Armenian and Syrian dishes.  No matter your experience with food of the Middle East or Mediterranean, you'll find dishes you recognize, perhaps by different names.\\n\\nThis was my first visit, I'm sitting here eating my takeout order as I type this because it's that good.  I ordered the lentil soup, and several appetizer portions including hummus, moohamara, sarma, and falafel.    \\n\\nQuick review:\\n- lentil soup.  Awesome, just awesome.  Beautiful saffron color from the cooked down red lentils, just the right mix of cumin and lemon, and a back end of heat, I'm guessing from Aleppo pepper.  This is some thick soup, and filling, and for 2.50, you get a pint\\n\\n- Moohamara.  I wasn't going to get this.  I like roasted red bell pepper, and I've had dips and purees made of them, but I've never sought it out.  Mary, one of the owners, told me it was her favorite, best on the menu.  And holy COW was she right.  A smack of roasted red pepper is quickly deepened by a sweet hit of pomegranate and walnuts, ubelievably complex and wonderful.\\n\\n- Falafel.  Huge portion, perfectly deep-fried, with a really nice, light texture.  Love the falafel, but I prefer tahini sauce, and these come with a yogurt mint sauce.  Don't get me wrong, this is clearly their regional interpretation, Im all about the authentic experience, and this was good sauce.  But, I confess that for my leftovers I'm making some tahini sauce.\\n\\n- Hummus.  You know, hummus is always a crap shoot for me.  I make my own, from dried chick peas, and I've been working on this recipe for 25 years (along with my Bloody Mary recipe and about a hundred others). This is another of those regional interpretation issues, this was my least favorite today.  I'll try it again, because my own hummus has on and off days.  This was just more on the bland side than I expected,  No one distinct flavor dominated so I felt like it was left with an almost indescribable flavor.  Not bad, totally edible, just oddly unflavored.  I added some lemon and salt, which helped some.  \\n\\nSarma - if you're expecting dolmathes this will be familiar in flavor, but it texture.  These are served cold with a yogurt dipping sauce.  I'm okay with the temperature, but I just like a little lemon on mine.  These are veg, the rice filling is cooked down to a coarse 'risotto-y' consistency.  I dig them, but those who prefer the snap of dolmathes will find these softer, but just as flavorful\\n\\nAll in all, outstanding.  Next time, shish tahouk and baba ganouj."}

This is the same showroom that features Donny & Marie and George Wallace.\\n\\nWhile waiting in line, I realized I was perhaps 3 decades younger than everyone else, but what the heck!  We had balcony seats at a table.  We sat with a couple from Ontario, Canada.

She is an Aussie who moved to England at 18 and sang in lounges.  She sang songs she was inspired by, like \\\"Cry Me a River\\\" by Julie London (in V for Vendetta for my generation).  Olivia sang from Xanadu, from her country hits in her early days, songs from her 90s album Gaia, and of course...PHYSICAL!\\n\\nThe most excitement for the crowd came from her 4 minute montage of her life early in the show, with pictures hinting at the order of her career, and the nod to Grease.

My waitress Sherrie was a total delight; I never saw a smile leave her face.\\n\\nI ordered a breakfast sandwich on a croissant (75 cents extra, totally worth it), sub bacon instead of ham, and sub scrambled eggs instead of the over hard egg just like I saw in a picture here on yelp.  It was great!  Loads of bacon, the eggs were great (not dry like other breakfast places like to serve you).  The hashbrowns were good - although not seasoned at all, like another reviewer noted, so I had to salt them myself... but that seems to be a norm for breakfast places like these, since a lot of their clientele is of the older generation who can't handle salt.\\n\\nLots of regulars here, lots of people just sitting drinking coffee and reading the paper.  Although one woman was totally rude and annoying - my waitress was taking the order of a woman sitting at the table next to me, and a woman at the table across the aisle threw her wadded-up straw wrapper at the waitress while she was taking the order - it almost landed in the full pot of coffee on the table - then apologized to the customer getting her order taken, saying she was trying to hit the waitress, and let out the most ungodly hyena-like guffaw I've ever heard.  I get that you know the waitress and you're trying to be funny, but jesus christ.  Have some respect and try to contain yourself.  She was at least 60 years old btw.\\n\\nANYWAY, overall it was a great experience and I had a good time just sitting there eating watching the price is right on their 20-year-old television.

{"_id": 3, "text": "Whenever I'm home for the holidays, I can always look forward to my reacquaintance with Tin Tin.  I typically go on a weekday for lunch, when the price tag at $8.95 is much more palatable than the roughly doubled dinner price.  All in all, Tin Tin is a great rendition of the ubiquitous chinese buffet.  \\n\\nAs a big fan of sushi, my go-to chinese buffet has to have a respectable offering.  If you're a sushi snob, you're not gonna be overwhelmed, but you'll usually do a lot worse elsewhere.  At the very least, you can count on a good selection beyond the boring staples of california and philadelphia rolls, with about 6 different nigiri presentations including eel, snapper and salmon, another half-dozen rolled forms with many of the same fish, and a bonus offering of spicy salmon sashimi and eel hand rolls (usually, although offerings may vary day-to-day).  \\n\\nMy favorite hot item is probably the thick rice noodles (pad kee mao type), which may not satisfy a thai craving, but is yummy nonetheless.  My biggest complaint is that this is one of the few items Tin Tin seems to rotate out, usually for singaporean noodles which I find to be incredibly \\\"meh\\\".  That and the fact that the dessert leaves a lot to be desired are the reasons I took off a star.\\n\\nOtherwise, I also enjoy the butter shrimp with a salty fried exterior, the thai chicken with a yummy mix of sweet and spiciness, pork dumplings, and cream cheese puffs.  The sesame chicken will kick you in the teeth with an almost cloying amount of sweetness, but I generally mix in a couple pieces to complement a milder accompaniment, like fried rice or lo mein.  Try a piece of everything and find something you like, cause Tin Tin does not lack for selection.  If you've never been a fan of the chinese buffet, this place will probably not make you a convert, but otherwise I recommend giving it a go during lunch time and hoping they've got those rice noodles."}

The ambience was really quaint and the place was simply decorated for a home-feel. They had soothing instrumental Beatles music playing. Many Japanese were there paying their patronage.\\n\\nThere wasn't much special done to their chilled broth and the rice that came with the meal must have been sitting in the rice warmer for a while. It didn't complement or accent the soba very well. It had the slightest taste of soy added to it, but not any other real flavor. I did like that the eggplant (nasu) in the chilled broth was warm. The eggplant was done quite well. \\n\\nTheir noodles provide a moment of zen, just like what Steve W. said. Their service is pretty good, except I find their way of giving a check somewhat inefficient because they bring a little cup and after you leave money in the little cup, they seem to be expecting exact change because they don't check on you for a long while. We were almost going to switch out our bills for smaller bills when the server finally came to check on us. \\n\\nI know... they're the only ones in town doing soba. But I have had really good noodles. This place is okay for me. I would love to give it another shot in three months when it's scorching outside. That might just up them to \\\"Yay!

The main problem faced by the stadium's designers is that Phoenix is hot.  Hotter than hot.  So how do you make a stadium comfortable and cool when its 120 degrees F outside?  You could just design an indoor park like the Metrodome in Minnesota, but baseball indoors is awful.  Instead, the stadium uses a massive retractable roof.  The roof remains closed during sweltering days until the sun goes down.

Cheese slices are under $5, while ones with tons of toppings will push the price closer to $6. Whole pies are around $26-30 and may be a cheaper option if you're wanting more than 4 slices.

They didn't have oysters, or sushi, or anything good, really. The service was crappy. Our waitress barely ever checked up on us or cleared our table. We had to stack up our plates pretty high for her to finally come over and take them. We had to keep flagging her down for refills of water and coke. She kinda gave us the feeling she was avoiding us or ignoring us. I HATE THAT... especially at a place that's supposedly HIGH CLASS?!? I dunno what other people are raving about. Seriously, this place had a wide selection of breads, not a variety of foods. I guess a lot of people are drawn to the pasta station? I guess the majority of people who go here and \\\"LOVE IT\\\" are either really drunk or completely starved from gambling that they can't differentiate from the lack of quality in the food as well as the selection. Honestly, the only thing I liked about the buffet at Wynn was their dessert. They had gelatos, candy apples, cupcakes, creme brulee, flan, fruits, and customized crepes. \\n\\nRECOMMENDATION: GO TO BELLAGIO! It's only like $30 and they have a wider selection of food. \\n\\nIf you don't care about how much you spend and you're not a foodie, THEN THIS IS THE PERFECT PLACE FOR YOU!"}

It is quite disappointing however every time I go in there I see Chef Mark is walking around the restaurant rather than in the back cooking maybe hence that is part of the problem!!! I believe you get what you pay for however in this case I feel they have now become overpriced for a poor quality of Italian food as well as very small portions!!! I would recommend they get some new servers as well as new items on the menu or give you at least a fair portion for the price they are charging... So many better other kind restaurants in town that appreciate your business"}

{"_id": 3, "text": "No complaints about the quality of the haircut, but during my fourth visit, the barber (Bob) cutting my hair started negotiating price about halfway through the haircut.  Their standard price for a haircut is $15, and on my previous visits I've given him a $5 tip.  He said that haircuts \\\"like mine\\\" are extra work (I have thick hair, which requires using thinning shears), and he feels that I should pay $25 (!) for all the \\\"extra work\\\".  In over 40 years, I have *never* had a barber complain about my hair being hard to cut.  If he had said this up front, I would have walked out, but I couldn't really leave in the middle of a haircut.  Needless to say, I will be exploring other options in the future.\\n\\nUPDATE - I complained to the owner (Ernie), and he was very eager to make things right.  He said to come back next time and ask for him, and the haircut would be on the house.  I did, and was quite pleased with the result.  After a number of repeat visits over a period of a couple years (until I moved away), I would not hesitate to recommend this place - just avoid Bob (the old guy in the far back)."}

I'm glad we returned in the daylight.\\n\\nWe took my inlaws yesterday after brunch and they absolutely loved DBG. My father-in-law is totally into photography, so DBG was awesome for him. We saw tons of people with cameras, so it is a photographer's haven.  I really had no clue there were so many types of cactus. There are hands on activities scattered throughout (probably for kids on field trips) and boards with information, which comes in handy on the Sonoran Desert Trail when you want to figure out which mountain in the distance is Camelback, Piestewa, Four Peaks, etc.  We saw little lizards, hummingbirds, quail, and ground squirrels while wondering around as well.\\n\\nThere is much to see and you can get through the gardens as quickly or as leisurely as you would like.

I had done my research before going to Vegas, but since I was with my daughter and I like to have flexible days, I didn't want every meal planned out and reserved. So we hit a few places based on proximity, hunger factor, and what sounded good. This was one of those MISSES.\\n\\nOur hotel room TV made Zine sound so fabulous. They really played up the black pepper beef, so that's what I was craving. And my daughter and I love dim sum, so they drew us in with that as well.\\n\\nWell, there is no dim sum. They've got appetizers that you would see on any Asian restaurant menu. Period. Dim sum? Not really. Ambience was really nice. Service was really good. Food was MEH and it was outrageously expensive. Our meal was $104 and we had no alcohol and we didn't even eat the $30 plate of Walnut Shrimp. Yes, $30 for what you get at any Chinese place. Only this wasn't good and my daughter ate one shrimp and then pushed the plate aside. They really should have comped us.\\n\\nThe black pepper beef, I will grant them, was super tender. But it was flavorless. Literally. And it was $32!\\n\\nWe also shared pot stickers (standard) and Vietnamese Egg Rolls that came with a clear sauce that we couldn't figure out if there was any flavor at all. It definitely wasn't fish sauce. I love fish sauce. These rolls were really bland.\\n\\nSo Let Me Repeat: If you want to throw away your money on bland, overpriced food, this is your place. If you want better food, go to McDonalds. If you want to spend your money on fabulous food, go to Gordon Ramsay Steak or Raku. Those were my two planned dining experiences and they did not fail me."}

{"_id": 2, "text": "For years, when going to the theater, my friend and I have eaten across the street at Indian Spices, or occasionally next door at Christo's, looking out one window and into the window of Lemon Grass.  They never looked especially busy (but then during theater times, I've rarely been anywhere downtown that really WAS 'especially busy') and we really didn't know anything about it.  So on this particular foray into a night with Lily Tomlin, we thought we'd try something different.\\n\\nI see all the growling reviews here complaining about...well...everything...from service to food, and frankly, I'm not quite sure we were all at the same restaurant.\\n\\nI'm also a bit confused by most people calling it 'Thai' when the menu says 'Cambodian'.\\n\\nLemon Grass was pleasant.  They did seem to operate with minimal staff, but they certainly seemed to keep up.  There was a small group of diners when we arrived, and that number grew while we were there, seemed like mostly people who were going to the same show we were.\\n\\nThe menu options were quite ethnic and unusual from things I'd seen on most Asian menus, which to me, was very cool. Couldn't pronounce them, but the ingredients were certainly unlike the others, so we decided to try a couple of dishes we'd never tried before, including an appetizer.\\n\\nThe appetizers were called 'Na Taings' and were like little non-sweet rice krispie treats that came with a very yummy pork and curry sauce to top them with.  There were five on the plate.  Several of their appetizers came 5 to the plate.  Ok folks, what is UP with the odd numbers on appetizer plates around here lately?  If you're sharing with another person, do we really want to incite a riot over who gets the last one?  Even Stevens is best on any shared plate.  Two for you, two for me, or three for you, three for me...not 'Oh no, you go ahead'  'No, YOU go ahead, really'.\\n\\nAnyway, the appetizer was quite tasty and hit the spot.\\n\\nMy friend ordered hot tea, which seemed to come in a magical pot.  The pot was only about two inches tall, and about as round as a very small tortilla, but it filled both of our normal sized cups three times.  It was a beautiful little creation of a pot, I must say. It looked like cast iron, and was very ornamental, and came with its own matching trivet to rest upon.  The tea was a very flavorful jasmine. How six cups managed to fit in that tiny pot is amazing.\\n\\nFor the entrees, I cannot remember the names of the dishes, nor can I find them listed online. Lemon Grass doesn't seem to have its own website, and all of the menu sites only appear to have a minimalist lunch menu, or something outdated.\\n\\nMy friend ordered something with many vowels and consonants, that was a seafood-curry-vegetable mix on a bed of 'crispy rice noodles', and I ordered another dish with many vowels and consonants, that was a pork based curry and vegetable (but lower on the veggie count) also over a bed of crispy rice noodles.\\n\\nAfter the waitress took our order, she came back from the kitchen to inform my friend that the dish she'd ordered was out, so my friend opted for the same as I.\\n\\nThe dishes arrived.  There was a giant mound of crispy white rice noodles, and they were indeed 'crispy', with a decent sized spot of the actual meat and curry portion nestled against it, with a ginormous decorative flower made of beet (my plate) and carrot (her plate) on a landscaping of parsley.  We switched plates...beets make me gag.  Then the waitress asked if we wanted chopsticks, and well...not so functional for a blind woman, but I opted to use them.\\n\\nThe dish was unusual and quite delicious - but a CHORE to eat, with either a fork OR chop sticks.  The first bite I tried to take with the chop sticks literally thrust the end of a very rigid rice noodle right up my right nostril.  In my friend's case, even with a fork, rice noodles were flying.  But, all in all, it was quite delicious. It was pork, a curry gravy, some bean sprouts, and fried egg strips.  Honestly, except for the grrrrrr of trying to contain the crispy rice noodles to the plate, it was a tasty and filling meal.  Quite pleasant, and it was nice to try something 'new' to us.\\n\\nThe bill wasn't outrageous, just under $40 for two entrees, an appetizer, and a pot of tea.\\n\\nWe both agreed that we'd go back...but next time we'll avoid the 'crispy' noodles for something a bit more malleable like rice or soft noodles.\\n\\nThe staff was fine and helpful - the food decent.  Heck the only thing that made the evening even slightly unpleasant was the cackling yinzer at one table who apparently thought she was in her own dining room at home.\\n\\nFor the pre-theater or concert scenario, I do recommend it.  It's worth a shot, especially if you're an 'outside the box' eater.  Try something you can't pronounce...what the heck."}

It was probably the best part of the meal but no something I would ever order again.  I had the cobb salad for 15.25 and that was a huge let down.  Dressing was gross, chicken was gross, overall it was just sub par.  \\nWe decided to make up for the rest of the meal with some dessert.  Maybe not the best idea....\\nMy husband ordered an espresso (4.25) that came half full and cold.  We also ordered the chocolate chip cookie desert for 8.25 which was pretty good except that the icecream was caramel ribbon (or something caramel) which was way too sweet to go with the cookie.  Plain vanilla would have been much better, the dish was entirely too sweet and this is coming from two individuals with HUGE sweet tooths.  \\nLong story short, this restaurant is overpriced and the food is not good.  I would never go back and I would never recommend it to anyone."}
{"_id": 1, "text": "We are a family of 4 with two small children and had my brother visiting. Most high-end Montreal hotels accept up to 4 guests per room even for suites. I had a hard time finding a room for 5. This Westin was the only one that had a suite with two double beds and a sleeper sofa for 5 guests. The room was spacious and nicely appointed, but came with a high price tag. Although they charged for the 5th person, there were only 4 sets of bedding and towels. The sleeper sofa had crumbs of chips and other junk food under bottom cushions. The room was never made the next morning. When we requested extra bedding and the room be cleaned, nobody came for 30 minutes. Concierge hesitated to recommend restaurants frequented by locals and not by tourists and insisted on going to canned places on the map. The highlight of our stay was the swimming pool. The bottom of the pool can be seen from the hotel entrance on the atrium ceiling as if it was a fish tank. There were 3 pools - a heated one for swimming, a large hot tub and a tub with cold water. That made our kid's weekend. Gym looked very nice, though we never used it. We stayed at many nice suites at other locations within similar price range and always had a wonderful time. We expected a lot more from a reputable name like Westin for a higher end room. That said, it's a nice option for business travellers. I wouldn't recommend it for family weekend away."}

In fact, if you read my previous reviews,  I often update and continuously lower the stars on a yearly basis.\\n\\nThis time it got pretty bad, for some reason the UNLV Parking and Enforcement sold 19,000 parking passes when there is just over 12,500 parking spots at any given time on campus. Local news coverage have covered this story in detail, such as KTNV and ABC 13 Action News (dated September 15th, 2014 available online \\\"UNLV students peeved over packed parking lots on campus\\\"). \\n\\nTo add fuel to the fire, for the first month and still ongoing, a majority of the white lot, that was meant for US, the PAYING STUDENTS who bought the passes, has been hijacked by tourists who take up hundreds of parking spots... MEANT FOR US, with semitrailers, Greyhound Bus Convoys, etc. \\n\\nNot only do we have to drive around wasting gas looking for a parking spot, but we often end up parking farther away from our classes that WE BORROWED AND SPENT TUITION MONEY ON, suffer from dehydration (I saw one lying on the ground on the first floor of the library being helped by cops and paramedics), and almost every lot is FULL. \\n\\nI drive a stickshift, and preferably I would NOT LIKE TO park inside the parking garage located next to Flamingo Road because of stop-and-go driving UPHILL and the extremely tight turning clearances we all have to make to get from one floor to another or to drive around a idiot student that is holding up traffic waiting for someone to back out. All of you fucks are contributing to the destruction of my clutch. \\n\\nWe have to endure the shit parking spots on a daily basis, even during our first exam week. We were the ones who paid to come here, to put up with incompetent teachers, lousy parking spaces, overzealous parking enforcement, and all of these tourist convention shitheads that want to make UNLV basically their semester residence, which displaces the rest of us from getting to class on time, or even to class at all. \\n\\nNowdays I advise just showing up on campus about 1 or 2 hours earlier. Just skip breakfast and your shower and just get to campus. Your going to lose your hygiene anyways from all the sweat pouring out your body from the miserable 20-30 minute walk out in 100+ degree fahrenheit weather.

{"_id": 4, "text": "Years ago, I reviewed the Black Bear Diner's original restaurant in Mount Shasta, California. I have a soft spot in my heart for this chain because it started essentially in my hometown's back yard, in a remote northern part of California that some call the State of Jefferson. You can see on their placemat, a black bear framed by the snow covered peaks of the extinct volcano, Mt. Shasta, in the background. I am pleased as punch that they have a franchise in Gilbert now that I am living in Arizona.\\n\\nThe food here is some solid, stick-to-your-ribs comfort food. The portions are huge. And it has that old-fashioned diner food vibe. This has been covered in many of the reviews posted by my fellow Yelpers. However, there are some unique nuances at this diner that you might have missed...\\n\\nFor one, they sell their own line of hot sauces. This includes Baby Burn (original cayenne), Mama Burn (green jalape\\u00f1o), and Papa Burn (haba\\u00f1ero). I am hooked on the Papa Burn, even though I'm not a huge haba\\u00f1ero hot sauce fan. My tastes tend towards the cayenne and chipotle varieties, but this Papa Burn sauce is special. It has some serious heat from the haba\\u00f1ero, but the best component is the infused black pepper flavor. Try it the next time you're here and you might just buy a bottle to go (like I did).\\n\\nThe other thing you may have missed is that the Black Bear Diner serves craft beer! Hop Rod Rye Specialty Ale and Big Bear Black Stout are the two offerings they carry from the Bear Republic Brewery. I have tried neither of these, but they sound delicious! I tend to frequent Black Bear Diner for breakfast, and really haven't made beer with breakfast a habit since college. I know the Yreka, California Black Bear Diner restaurant used to serve a special label craft beer brewed at the Etna Brewery, so I was pleased to see that the beery bear tradition continues at this Gilbert restaurant."}

Aloha Kitchen offers a touch of the island vibe away from the hustle and bustle of the strip. Order at the counter, sit down, then wait for your meal to arrive at your table. Locals, students from nearby UNLV, and Yelp-savvy tourists populate the restaurant. \\n\\nThe adobo fried rice omelette is lip-smacking good. The adobo and fried rice are garlicky and flavorful, with the omelette cooked to delectable perfection. I tore through most of the enormous serving before hitting the wall about 3/4 of the way through it. I couldn't eat another bite, so I boxed it up for a late-night snack after a visit to the casinos. My wife ordered the pork kahlua and it was tender, smoky, and a huge serving. We also tried the spam musubi, which was your standard spam wrapped in rice and seaweed.

As soon as I walked in, the feeling of a fine, classy, sophisticated, elegant italian place is the vibe you get. Not to mention, for its \\\"space\\\", it's adorable. Nice bar, live italian music playing and a good amount of well-dressed people have let me know this is a decent place.\\nWe didn't have to wait very long which was nice. While we did wait, we were able to watch the cooks preparing authentic italian food. When we sat down everything was formal, almost as if we were on a  spot on the strip. Though the room started to remind me a little bit of an office building, the decor made up for it as the ceilings were decorated and the walls were dressed as if it may be your own grandmothers dining room. Cute. \\nI enjoy when the servers are wearing vests because I know I will get the quality I want. But downfall was the server took a long time at first. The complimentary italian garlic bread is a bit buttery for my own diet but the fact it wasn't just a basket of butter packets and bread made this place a little different then the others & also, the fact that it had fresh, chopped garlic on it  as well made up for the too much butter .When we got our dishes the food was perfect and just enough. One of the dishes we ordered was the 'Alla Nora' and I'd recommend it if you like a robust meat sauce (bolognese)  with breaded eggplant - fried. Comes with spaghetti obviously. Not bad if this is one of their signature dishes -assuming.\\nFor the lack of perfect service the girl made up for it by bringing us a complimentary dessert. Or was it because we told her it was our first time there? :) Either way, Tiramasu is definitely not my type of dessert but its the thought that counts.\\nI'd recommend this restaurant for a special birthday or a romantic, quiet dinner. I would definitely come back to try out something different on the menu since I was satisfied with the other menu items. I'd recommend this place also with another couple or a date because it's definitely one of the more intimate places to go, even if it's just to have a glass of wine and listen to the live italian music."}

So I called the manager on duty, lets call him \\\"T\\\". He was SUPER kind and wrote me down for a comp the next time I came in which was tonight. \\nI came all the way from phoenix but wanted to claim my free meal on the way home so I stopped in. It took them 15 MIN to bring out my comp order, but it was wrong again because they didn't read the order back to me to verify (and they never have). So I told the carhop and it took another ten minutes to get the correct burger out to me. By this time, my side item was cold. I had every intention of tipping the carhop even though I was claiming a free order. But she was so distant and lacked people skills and didn't remember the things I requested and didn't look me in the eyes, plus my order was wrong a third time. By the time I rode home, my food was cold (I even had it in a warm environment for the whole journey) and there was little to no condiments on my burger! Who wants a dry burger? Not this guy.\\nAll I can say, is the night manager on duty every time I go there looks like a punk (hood always covering his face, and I sound old for saying that, but I'm a 25 year old punk rocker myself, haha) and the kitchen seems to be stoned because I witnessed 3 inaccurate orders while I was trying to claim mine. \\nMy main complaint is that I worked at Sonic for over 2 years, and this kind of behavior at my locations would've gotten me fired. I've returned to the restaurant business since then and my philosophy is STILL to treat the customer how you would like to be treated. What's so hard about that?! Yeah, it's fast food. Yeah, they get paid minimum wage. But if you cant even follow your recipes, common sense, and core values, you don't deserve to have the job. There's many people out of work who would kill to have a job, even at Sonic.\\nIt's sad because this location is RIGHT by my house and it's good for a quick, cheap meal, but I will not be returning. This is absolutely the WORST Sonic experience I've ever had and it's the worst Sonic I've been to. What a shame, too, because it's in such a nice area.

I took one bite and the rubber martian cheese filled my mouth. It tasted like I was chewing silly putty that someone poured tomato paste from a can on it.

Unfortunately we were still super full from breakfast so we did not partake in the deli, which smelled amazing.\\n\\nThe free drinks were nice and strong and I got a pretty good buzz while gambling!  The dealer was funny and witty and it was nice to have her engaging the table rather than just standing there dealing like most of the places.\\n\\nMy only gripe is about the roller coaster.  We wanted to go on it, but I had a small cross body purse with me.  I needed to put it in a locker but I had no quarters.  I went into the roller coaster gift shop and they refused to break my $10 - I had to buy something (which I refused to do).  So, if I wanted change, I'd have to cash in my $10 all to quarters, which was out of the question.  I ended up getting annoyed and pulling hubby out of line and we just left rather than dealing with that pain in the ass.  For the money, I can't imagine it's really worth it - we live 2 hours from a real amusement park so I'd rather just go there!"}

Next came our drinks, 2 margaritas, and this is the only place where we knocked a star. They were so weak I order a shot of Patron to add to mine...and I am not a drinker. Our entrees came quickly.  The grilled mahi-mahi with guacamole was perfectly cooked, just a little salty for my taste. The steamed veggies were yummy too.  Hubby's French dip was good and the sweet potato fries were crisp and fluffy.  Dessert was a cheesecake - typical, but yummy.  Heather, our server was stellar.

However, there is a lack of service here that needs to be pointed out. After our first night., housekeeping came in the middle of us having breakfast. I told them to come back in about an hour and we should be done. We got dressed and before we left the hotel, I called to request the room be serviced. When we came back, it was not serviced at all. All our dirty dishes and such were still hangin around. No towels refreshed. The next morning, we had to clean our own dishes before leaving.

Jaleo provides smaller portions but doesn't have as wide a variety of food as one would hope for and definitely doesn't have the lower prices. \\n\\nJaleo then suffers from another problem - they fry just about every dish. Spanish food is not necessarily heavy or populated by fried items, but Jaleo's menu is just loaded up with fried options when it simply doesn't need to be. Even the datillos con tocino (dates with bacon - an absolute tapas staple) is fried. i've never seen that, why ruin the dish by frying it?\\n\\nBecause of that maybe the best dish we had was the sliced apple and fennel salad - it was just so fresh and such a welcome, refreshing change. The other dish that was very good was the skirt steak with piquillo peppers - another common Tapas dish - that was done well.

They were so sandy that it felt like I threw a handful of sand in my mouth and started chewing. One order seemed overcooked.

As with the scallops, I have had much more flavorful short rib for a fraction of the price elsewhere. I would not order this again at this restaurant.\\n\\nThe steak was nothing special, honestly, and I felt was about twice as costly as necessary for what it was.\\n\\nThe scotch egg was actually very good. Probably one of the better/best scotch eggs I've had. I would order this again.\\n\\nThe sticky toffee was great, and I would order it again.

Bottle service at the club was a total rip off, certainly not worth the 400 bucks.  We had to walk up 3 flights of what was probably the most gross filthy old staircase I've ever seen (in heels!, wtf?). We were seated outside by the bar on these crappy mat-bench things (which were dirty and dusty).  They looked like wrestling mats that you'd see in a high school gymnasium. Also, these gross old hags came over and sat on the bench next to us (they didnt buy a bottle or pay to sit there) and were smoking cigarettes. We had to track down security to ask them to leave. Anyway, the environment was so lame and I was so irritated that I drank waaaay to much (so I wouldn't be aware how badly everything sucked). I blacked out and woke up the next day in my room at the Encore. I was delighted to see that my wallet (and the 3 grand inside it) had been stolen. Being in Vegas with no ID, wonderful, let me tell ya. Needless to say, it was a very disappointing birthday. If you are looking for a special experience, this is not the place. I don't understand why it gets so much press, it's a real dump. Now I know why they have to pay celebs so much to go here.  If they weren't getting paid, they wouldnt be caught dead here.

{"_id": 1, "text": "Even after reading all the reviews, I gave SLS a benefit of a doubt and stayed there over the weekend. I wished I could give them a better rating as a newly opened hotel, but they're really far from a 4 stars hotel. I've stayed at a handful of hotels in Vegas and I'm sure SLS is no where near the other 4 stars rated hotels.\\n\\nFirst, their parking structure elevator did not work the whole weekend while we were there. How could they not fix the issue at all? How do those with wheel chair get to the hotel from parking structure? We had a stroller so we would walked down all the levels in the parking garage and cross the road where people are entering to the structure. It was not the safest route to take but we had no choice. We definitely did not want to carry the stroller down flights of stairs in this heat!\\n\\nSecond, registration was so disorganized. There's no lines so people were randomly standing and the person behind the counter would call the next person who nearly just walked up while the rest of us have been waiting in line for 15 minutes. \\n\\nThird, our room had hair here and there around the bathroom and bed...did they even clean the room or change the sheets? gross! Even the drinking glass had things on it from the previous guests since they forgot to replace the glass with clean ones.\\n\\nLastly, ...and this was a huge one for me. I'm traveling with my baby and needed my ice packs in the freezer so I have it ready on the day I go home. I called front desk, bell desk and concierge and every person either, don't know how to help me, told me they can't do it or told me they'd call me back with an answer...which none of them called me back. This is the first hotel I've stayed at that does not offer this service. Those that knows me, knows I travel to Vegas and stay at hotels often and I travel for work around the country so I've stayed at countless numbers of hotels and this is the first hotel that told me they can't freeze ice packs for me. Serious?? I wasn't going to have my baby's milk get spoiled so of course had to improvise and hassle other friends for their help.\\n\\nWould I stay at SLS again? Probably not if I have a choice."}

It was a whole roasted poblano pepper filled with a blend of 4 cheeses, dipped in an egg batter and cooked, then smothered in a light and flavorful tomato and onion based sauce.  Awesome!

{"_id": 3, "text": "Monday was Industry Night here at Cleo, and it's the first one yet.\\n\\nMaybe our server thought she wouldn't be tipped because my table of 6 felt ignored. \\n\\nIt took at least 20 minutes for her to greet the table, and from there another half hour to get the pita bread down (with the most amazing taziki sauce I've ever had- so I ordered more).

I don't know where he was during the first 30 minutes of our meal but other bussers would come and pick up one thing, or nothing at all. At one point my friend piled dishes on the seat next to her, and I had some on the table stacked, hoping someone would clear it. The food runners should really be picking things up that are overcrowding the table so they can make room for the new items, our runner must've notice how much unused dish ware we had because she told us a busser would be over soon. Note she didn't take a single thing off of the table.\\n\\nThey need to really work on keeping tables bussed and unused items out of the way. Maybe throughout the meal drop new share plates... \\n\\nIt's unfortunate that almost a month after opening this place is still dis functional. \\n\\nAt one point I saw what looked like a customer (because she was in street clothes and holding a purse I assumed she was a customer) completely rip into a food runner.

{"_id": 1, "text": "My friend sent me the Yelp page for Hek Yeah and what do you know?  4.5 stars based on 51 reviews!  Damn impressive....or so it would seem.  Well, since I can't, for the life of me, find reasonable BBQ here in Phoenix off to Hek Yeah I go.  Fingers crossed.\\n\\nI showed up at opening on a Saturday and was the first customer of the day.  I thought for a second that the restaurant was still closed because the lights were off and the chairs were still on the tables.  However, the neon \\\"Open\\\" sign was lit and the owner was there welcoming me in.  It looked like he arrived just minutes before me.  After turning on the lights, firing up the point-of-sale system and taking down the chairs, the owner talked me through a few items on the menu.  I ordered the 2 meat with ribs and 2 sides platter which rang up to about $21 with a drink.  I picked beef brisket and pulled pork for my meats.  Mac 'n' cheese and baked beans got the call for my sides.  I took a seat and waited for my order which did not take too long to come out.\\n\\nAPPEARANCE\\nThe food came out on a sizzling metal platter.  Portion sizes were very generous and it also came with a bread roll.  The pork was pulled or shredded as expected, but so was the beef brisket which caught me a little off guard.  I guess I was expecting it to come out sliced which is always my preference.  Why?  Because when it is sliced it tells me two things:  1.  It was cooked properly. When brisket gets overcooked it becomes difficult to slice and you end up having to pull, chop, or shred it.; and 2.  It is a good quality piece of beef.  When you pull, chop or shred beef you can usually get away with using cheaper meat.  Often times, the shredded meat is tossed with fat drippings or sauce which compensates for poorer quality meat.  However, for the sake of this review, let's give the benefit of the doubt and chalk this presentation up to preference.  Many people choose to shred their brisket because that's how they like to do it for sandwiches or perhaps it was a \\\"slice the flat, chop the point\\\" type decision.  Food was hot and all appeared fine.\\n\\nTASTE & TENDERNESS\\nTo start, I went straight for the ribs.  Well, actually what I got was more the \\\"flap\\\" than actual ribs.  Either way, I pick them up by the bone and the meat literally fell off the bone.  Despite what Outback Steakhouse or Chili's commercials will lead you to believe, fall off the bone ribs are NOT GOOD.  This means that the meat was OVERCOOKED and the way this meat just fell apart leads me to believe that it was not cooked that day.  Tasting the meat confirmed this suspicion as it was practically disintegrating in my mouth and it also felt and looked like it was heated up in the microwave.  The pulled pork and beef brisket were equally flavorless and dry.  The bread was \\\"crusty\\\" on the outside, but not very warm on the inside.  On a positive note, I really liked the baked beans and the mac 'n' cheese.  They were cooked properly, seasoned well and tasted good.\\n\\nTo sum it up, I was very disappointed with the food.  I just paid $21 for overcooked, underseasoned, dry flavorless food.  On top of that, due to the taste and texture of the food, I highly suspect that the food was not fresh (read \\\"made the day BEFORE\\\").  Again, this is just my suspicion, but I look at it like this.....if the food was made fresh (i.e., that morning), but still tasted like it was made the day before and reheated then there are some other problems going on here that need to be addressed.  So, sorry Yelpers.  The hyperbole on Hek Yeah BBQ stops here.  If somebody asks me to join them for BBQ at this place my response will be, \\\"HEK NO!\\\""}

Dirty Franks Hot Dog Palace (Columbus, OH), Jack's Cosmic Dogs (Mount Pleasant, SC), a tour of the Vienna Beef factory in Chicago immediately followed by nom noming on some dogs--- if you want a great dog try one of these places.\\n\\nIf you want a disappointing, soggy bun that will fall apart as soon as you pick up your dog, which is too long for the bun and not accompanied by enough toppings, then stop by Station Street.  'Maybe I ordered the wrong dog?' I thought, as I picked up my much anticipated Hawaiian dog, only to find that before even biting into it the dog and half my toppings had fallen through the what was once bun but was now two pieces of soggy bread.  But then I looked at my boyfriend's Kimchi dog and saw that it, too, would soon meet the same fate.  The hot dog itself was tasty, and the toppings would have been good if there were any way to keep them on my dog once it was out of the bun.  But there is nothing worse than trying to eat a soggy bun.  I tried to finish my hot dog but ended up opting to fill up on the fries, which were quite tasty.  \\n\\nBased on all the positive reviews I am guessing not everyone's hot dogs were such a disappointment.

I seem to always go to the regular bar when it's karaoke night (not my cup of tea).  Drinks aren't bad.  Decor theme goes with the name of the place with barrel like tables set up in strategic locations where you have to dodge the fifty people on each side of it to get to the back where the bathroom is.\\n\\nFor all the aspiring strippers out there, try your luck on the lighted platform complete with a pole.\\n\\nOne of the best attributes to the Saloon is the after-hours club located upstairs called Tilden.  Membership is a yearly basis fee of around $15.  You'll have access to the upstairs which has a bigger, better dance floor.  Last time I was up there they were still in the middle of a remodel which made it a better place to navigate with the bar up against the wall instead of in the middle of the room.  Downside, they got rid of the back bar.  Worst night to go is probably Sundays, not much going on there."}

I will go back just because the experience was awesome, but I won't be the one suggesting it, because of the food.  The food was alright, but not outstanding.  I do like the options.  They have a duck taco and a lamb taco.  So that's fun.  However, the tacos were small.  For $4-$5 a taco, two should fill me up.  And you don't get a free side unless you buy 3 tacos, otherwise they run about $2.50.  I had a side of rice which probably wouldn't have filled up my hand.  I get that they are quality local ingredients, but I feel like the markup is a little ridiculous.  If you have a large appetite and a small budget, I DO NOT recommend Taco Guild.

Got at the station in time to buy a ticket and such. The bus left without me! I was at the station buying a ticket The ticket sales dude forgot maybe o say hold on!! My mom chased the bus and I was waving and trying to show the man my ticket. He looked but no action. We were at coming to a stoplight...if he wanted to he could have let me in during that light. \\n\\nI had to take a 6am express flight back to Vegas so I can make it to work. \\n\\nThey canceled the two charges on my debit card but would not refund my ticket from the bus leaving since I was \\\"at fault for not showing up earlier\\\". I was there buying my ticket- they left me, 5 minutes earlier than scheduled too so I thought I should've been safe. \\n\\nThis was some sort of cosmic karma joke I thought, but after telling friends and family- many offered stories of GH mishaps. \\n\\nNever again.

I understand the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however, the food was incredibly over-priced, came out COLD (as in, sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and I literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink. It was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (Not to mention, my glass was dirty, and I saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. I know the Food and Beverage Commission would be as disappointed as I was.) The service was terrible. Don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. \\n\\nWas it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade? Yes. If you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games, I suppose I would advise you give it a shot. I would never recommend their food, customer service, or drinks.

All these people can't be wrong, riiiiight? For example The Royal Sub won LV Weekly Best Sandwich, so Pizza Cat tried half a sub for $7. It has italian sausage, cappicola and mozzarella. And that's exactly what you get, those ingredients, smashed into a tasty roll. LOL. Not bad, the cappicola was high quality and the italian sausage tasted a lot like Johnsonville and Pizza Cat likes Johnsonville sausage. Presentation was sloppy but how can you go wrong with a heaping of those ingredients on a fresh roll? For $7, it was a tasty sammie. \\n\\nNow Pizza Cat prefers to smoke but on occassion she will take a sip. Being inside the super-divey Moondoggies has its advantages, such as a full bar. She meandered to where a handful of locals were guffhawing over some guy puking on the TV (true story). She told the cute bartender, something light and fruity (cuz Pizza Cat can't afford any more DUIs) and under $10. The bartender proceeded to take out an 18 oz red cup (like at a BYOB party, yes, that red cup) and guzzle an interesting mixture of rum, something sweet and more rum. He presented it with a smile and said, \\\"$5.\\\" \\n\\n$5!!!! Yeeesh. This is the Vegas, baby. \\n\\nSo Pizza Cat waited for her food and proceeded to get toasted. She realized halfway through her sippy cup that the bartender had hooked her up and she was going nowhere soon. Good thing the food took so damn long to make. \\n\\nAfter 30 mins or so Pizza Cat was rewarded with a big azz pizza, which they called a wee, but it's not wee at all, and it was heaped with meatballs, fresh spinach and globs of ricotta. For $13 it was a hell of a deal. \\n\\nNow, if this was K.D., and a drunk K.D. at that, the pizza would've been fine, but Pizza Cat is a cat and Pizza Cat says the dough is nasty and the pizza is sloppy. But who cares what Pizza Cat thinks??? She is drunk, in a dive bar with other drunks, laughing at Adult Swim. Life does not get better than this. \\n\\nViva Las Vegas. Viva Naked City Pizza."}

It's good pub grub with a few twists on the menu, particularly the choice of nachos options, there's classics with just salsa,guacamole and sour cream, chilli nachos adds beef chilli, chicken nachos adds chicken and fried peppers, then there's haggis or veggie haggis nachos, both with whiskey sauce and steak strips too in the case of the standard haggis. \\n\\nAlso of note is the Sunday breakfast special, two full Scottish breakfasts for a tenner, so find a friend and it's only a fiver each or wait till you're ravenous and go and have two (the offer is on till 2pm on Sundays). I'm not sure how long it'll run for though as it's become quite popular."}

Today, the vacuum literally sparked, smoked, and nearly caught the carpet on fire. I immediately called Walmart, spoke with Kathy, and she said it would be no problem that I did not have a receipt or box, it could be returned. I go to return it, get a new vacuum in exchange, and head to customer service. The lady at customer service was excellent. The real problem came when she needed to get her supervisor for approval. After calling him twice and waiting twenty minutes, he arrived! He told us we would be unable to return it, only exchange it for the same one. Umm, why would I want the same vacuum that nearly caught my floor on fire? We explained that we wete prepared to spend nearly $70 on a different vacuum, and he said no, I can't help you. Did not offer any apologies, any suggestions, any help. Just no. We asked to speak to another \\\"manager\\\" and after another 10 minutes she arrived. While playing with her phone and not even looking at us, she gave me the same response. No apologies. Just walked away. I am thoroughly disappointed and extremely angry. Kenneth and Amanda provided me with the worst customer service I have ever had. I've never written a review ever. But these two inexperienced, unapologetic, rude supervisors rubbed me the wrong way. Never again will I step foot in that store."}

Inside tip: They also have chocolate custard not just vanilla. This I found out after a few visits. I always get chocolate custard with chocolate sauce and Oreo cookies. I think its the best.\\nThe burgers are really good. So are the onion rings and the cheese curds. I have never heard of cheese curds before Culvers. Must be a Wisconsin thing but they are really good. To call them fried cheese balls don't do them justice. Just try them. If you like cheese you will like these.\\nThe service is pretty good. Sure it takes awhile to get your food but that just means they are making it fresh. For that I am willing to wait. Plus they give you your concrete first so you can enjoy that while you pull forward in the drive thru to wait for the rest of your order. They give you a number and then bring out your food right to your car.\\nIt is a little expensive to eat more than once a week but it is well worth it."}
{"_id": 1, "text": "I've been here twice, so this is a combined rating of both experiences.\\n\\nThe first time I went was in April at 6pm with my girlfriend. The  I ordered the the Chilled Edamame, Grilled Sweet Korean BBQ Beef and a half portion of the Ahi Crunchy Salad. I also ordered a glass of pinot noir and a large bottle of sparkling water. I can't recall what my friend ordered, so I'm only going to write about my experience. Our waitress seemed friendly enough, however she spoke so fast, that it was difficult to understand her. After we placed our order, we didn't see her for almost 20 minutes. A runner delivered my friend's drink and my sparkling water, however, the pinot noir was no where to be found. Then the edamame came out and my friend's appetizer, still no wine. We asked another waiter (not ours bc we still couldn't find her) if they could check on my wine. Our next courses came out -- Korean BBQ Beef, which was hot and tender with great sweet and tangy flavor and the white jasmine rice was hot and the perfect stickiness.  We started to eat, but I wanted to have my wine with my meal, so I ate slowly. 10 minutes later, I had to ask yet another waiter about the status of my wine, and they went to find our waitress, who finally brought my wine 15 minutes later. The Korean BBQ Beef was still good though, even though it was cold from waiting for the pinot noir. My salad came out shortly after by yet another waiter, then our original waitress came by and said that she was transitioning our table to another waiter since she was going on break, which was laughable bc to us, she had been on break for 45 minutes. Our new waitress asked us if we wanted to order dessert, which I did, a scoop of caramel ice cream. My GF also placed a take away order for her husband to bring home, so I assumed that while we waited for his food, the waiter would bring out my dessert. But instead, they brought out my dessert when they brought out his take away food. So I had to eat my ice cream really fast so the take away food wouldn't get cold. \\n\\nFood Score: A\\nService Score: D+\\nAtmosphere: B+ (a little loud, but fun and ively)\\n\\nThe second time I went to  YH was on Sat night during Memorial Day Weekend. The place was packed so we got put on the wait list, and then went to the bar. Fortunately, 2 seats opened up at the bar, so we decided to eat at the bar instead, which was good for me bc I knew that my drink would come out much faster than the time. Our bartender was friendly and took our beverage order right away while we looked at the menu. We both had Stellas and then we ordered the Onion Rings Tower and Hummus to start. The food came out pretty quickly and the onion rings were nice, crispy and hot, but the hummus was runny and slimy and had a weird after taste, so we didn't finish that dish. I had liked the Korean BBQ Beef dish the first time, so I ordered it again for my main, while my husband ordered the Spicy Jambalaya with Brown Rice. That food came out in a timely manner, however, my dish was very disappointing and my husband's came out with white rice, so they took it back. Instead of replating it, they scooped out the white rice and put brown rice on the same plate, which was now a total mess. My husband was so hungry and didn't want to wait, that he ate it anyway, but we both couldn't believe that it didn't get replated. I was really looking forward to my dish bc it was so good the first time, however, this time, the beef was dry, much smaller pieces, almost shriveled and lacking any of the juicy flavor from last time and the rice was also dry and cold. I was hungry, so I ate it anyway. I was afraid to send it back bc it could've been worse, especially after what happened to my husband's dish when he sent it back. Our bartender asked us if we wanted dessert and I told her we wanted the caramel ice cream and she said that they didn't have it. She told me that I must be mistaken, bc it's not on the menu. I told her that I had it last time in April, and she said that they didn't, but instead, recommended the salted caramel butterscotch pudding. We ordered that instead, and we're glad we did bc it was quite good. Still annoying though that she said that they didn't have caramel ice cream bc I just checked the menu online and there it was - \\n\\nICE CREAM\\nvanilla, caramel, mango sorbet, java chip, mint chocolate chip\\n\\nFood Score: C-\\nService Score: B+\\nAtmosphere: B+ (a little loud, but fun and ively)\\n\\nI really wanted to like this place based on previous reviews. My husband and I are both in the hospitality industry and we like to support local businesses, so we may give it one more try, especially since it's conveniently located. Hopefully the third time's a charm and the service and food will both be good."}

Once we saw the small plaza where Basil & Garlic Bistro was located, we said to each other that there was no way we would have found this place just by driving by because you just don't \\\"drive by\\\" the area where Basil & Garlic Bistro was located.\\n\\nOnto the food. it was all amazing.  The chicken steak deluxe has a wonderful mixture of meat, veggies, and cheese.  There was a HUGE chunk of pepperoni in each half of the sandwich and my fiancee commented that \\\"this is the amount of pepperoni some places put on an entire pizza!\\\"  My fiancee's Vongole pasta with red sauce and clams was one of the better pasta dishes we've ever had, anywhere. And it was only $14, definitely a great deal because you're at a family owned establishment in a local neighborhood.  We finished off the meal with homemade tiramisu which was not overly sweet and did not have an overdosing of rum.  It was decorated with drizzles of chocolate sauce and cocoa powder with bits of whip cream on the side.\\n\\nI come to Phoenix every so often for work and would definitely count Basil & Garlic Bistro as the place I'd try to come out to for dinner when my schedule allows me to make the drive out there."}

Lately when I've been on that side of town and wanted sushi, I'd go to Temari, remembering how good it used to be.\\n\\nNot anymore -- I made excuses for their decline in standards.\\n\\nI'm not sure if that sushi chef was being trained, etc, but the rolls were a bit off -- they fell apart easily and the fish just didn't taste as fresh as I remember it being. The rice for the sushi tended to fall apart far too easily -- that was pissing me off. I had more rice in my soy sauce dipping bowl than on the actual sushi roll itself. Yea, I was pretty peeved, but that was nothing compared to what had happened minutes before...\\n\\nTheir sushi menu is a bit confusing as well. I am used to a menu where you can check things off on the left hand side of the column, not the far right. I made the mistake of checking the box off to the left, thinking I was ordering california rolls and an eel roll. Imagine my surprise when sashimi arrived instead of nigiri.\\n\\nThey charged me for my mistake. It was an honest mistake and frankly, I love sashimi, but I've recently had a bad experience with sashimi in California that left me feeling like I was hovering close to death...I was in zero mood for raw fish. What should have cost me about $18 in sushi ended up being $30 for my mistake...lunch there used to cost me somewhere between $15-$20, including tip. When all was said and done, the bill was $42 for 2 people...and my cousin hadn't even ordered sushi!\\n\\nMy cousin had ordered the chicken teriyaki which she said tasted like they had just straight out added corn flour to soy sauce. She said she'd never had a bigger salt lick in her life. The chicken was overcooked and the only thing I *think* she enjoyed was the salad on her plate...oh and the rice that came with the meal.\\n\\nThe end of the meal came with complimentary ice cream -- as if that could make me think about coming back here again.\\n\\nThe service was fine, but I found the tables a bit sticky...like they didn't wipe it down well enough.

McCarran doesn't seem that bad anymore. Talk about low standards.\\n\\nArriving at McCarran is usually a smooth affair, the walk to the heavily advertised, spam filled baggage claim can be pretty fast even in the narrow corridors throughout the airport. Getting a taxi or shuttle is straightforward and the airport shuttle to the car rental center is a breeze & really convenient.\\n\\nLeaving is bit more difficult.

I was tired, got distracted, and left $40.00 cash back that I had received at one of the quick checkout locations.

I figured either someone had turned it in or they would actually engage in some professional and proper customer service.  \\n\\nWell, someone walked off with it, and the store refused to reimburse me.\\n\\nAnd, no, I do not think it was an outlandish request.  I work in an industry where we are generally required to fulfill this type of request on a constant basis.  It is called customer service.  If I was the manager of the store, or even the owner, I would have figured the $40.00 was more than worth keeping a customer.  And, yes, I have put this in practice privately as well, reimbursing peple who purchased items from me on eBay even though technically there was shared responsibility; it just makes good business sense as long as the person doesn't make repeated demands.\\n\\nAs for the store, it is better laid out, better maintained and many of the staff are friendlier than your typical Fry's location in Tempe.  No more than your typical big-name supermarket, but until today I was satisfied.

{"_id": 3, "text": "Sports bars with great service are bank in my book. Often, I visit ones where the rowdy action that's happening on TV and throughout the bar gives servers an excuse to neglect your dining needs or act hurried in their interactions, but I'm pleased to say Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers in Old Town Scottsdale is a great exception to this rule.\\n\\nI went there recently to watch the Indiana Pacers beat the Miami Heat (woo!) and had a great time chilling out on the mister-filled patio. We had prime seating in front of a large flat-screen television and a cool view of Old Town Scottsdale. Now I know why the patio is constantly packed whenever I drive by - the place has great food, a killer happy hour, 25 TVs and service with a smile.\\n\\nOne of the things that's greatest about Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers is that their happy hour lasts until 7 p.m., and starts at 3 p.m. It features great specials, including $3 domestic pints and $5 appetizers. \\n\\nAs the restaurant name implies, the beer list is huge, but my favorite part about the meal was the delicious grilled cheese sandwich and side salad. The sandwich comes with fries or chips for $8, and with my salad, it was only $10. This was great bar food, a huge portion, with three types of cheeses and tomato. I added avocado, which is my favorite way to have it. I was impressed with the fresh salad, and left taking half my sandwich home.\\n\\nMy companion's Turkey Burger ($12) also looked generous, and he said it tasted graet. I stole some of his sweet potato tots (an extra $2), and they were worth the splurge - perfectly crispy and, again, a massive portion that had him taking half the meal home. \\n\\nThroughout the night, I was pleasantly surprised any server that passed by our table checked on us. Servers should work as a team, helping out each other's tables with whatever they need, and that's the philosophy here - really impressive.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was fun, with friendly banter and cheering among tables for the games.

I love their pizza and frozen yogurt too much. It's too good and every time I walk into Costco I am always battling myself about whether or not I should walk out with a goodie. This point was not factored into my rating of Costco.\\n\\nAlright, so the first REAL problem I have with Costco is that buying fruit from them is always risky. There is absolutely no consistency with the quality of products they get in and you have to be really diligent about checking what you're grabbing. I must look like a loon when I spin my grapes around so that I can check and make sure there is absolutely no mold. I have a process down that reduces the risk, but I have had their fruit turn on  me a day after I bought it. Actually, I've seen them stock fruit that's already expired or that already have mold on it. Bad form Costco, bad form.\\n\\nAnother problem I have is the parking lot at this particular location. I always tell someone that I'm going to Costco and that if they don't hear from me within 3 hours then they should start calling the hospitals. This parking lot is a death trap. There are many blind curves that people come whipping around and there are practically no speed bumps so people are driving closer to 25-30 mph rather than 10-15mph.

It isn't dirty but it is a bit dark.  It isn't all-american diner, but there's a diner-esque  feel to the floor-plan.  But it is Irish, and that's super fun.\\n\\nMel U. wrote that the first impression was that of \\\"MAKEOVER TIME!\\\" and I agree.  But I wouldn't change their motif or the theme ... I just would update a little.  And perhaps send some of the staff to polishing classes.\\n\\nOur bartender had no issue making it clear she was tired, didn't really want to be there, and felt somewhat inconvenience by the fact that people showed up right at 430pm.  About 30 minutes later tho ... we were all laughing together and having a grande ole time!!  So I'll file that into \\\"crappy first impression\\\" archive and give her the benefit of the doubt. (I used to work retail, so I know sometimes customers is that last thing we want to see.)\\n\\nNow on to the booze and drinks!  Our drinks were STRONG.  Linda W. asked for a Dark&Stormy which caused the initial inconvenience wave since ginger beer was in the kitchen coolers.  I went with a basic Diet & Vanilla vodka.  Drinks were strong and good.  The D&S could have used some extra lime but it was heavy enough that it was good in its own right.\\n\\nThe food was good.  My burger was cooked to order and the sweet potato fries were scrumptious.  Linda W. was able to get a basket of fries which were a great value!\\n\\nThere are a couple drink-and-chill all the time type customers there so the conversation was rather interesting once Serena R. arrived dressed as Carmen SanDiego.

At least he did call to cancel both times, and, again, was very friendly.\\n\\nAnyway, because of Jim and Steven I did end up accepting the quote and giving the green light.\\n\\nOne of the techs did the actual cleaning (his name escapes me right now) and initially it all went very well too -- they used bead blaster to perform the cleaning (rather than acid) and he did call me twice to keep me posted on the progress and run a few things by me.\\n\\nOnce the pool was filled back up, Jim came back to add salt and CYA back to the pool.\\n\\nAnd that's when things started going South.\\n\\nI told Jim that I noticed that the other tech had left quite a bit of bead blaster at the bottom of the pool, and I asked for it to be cleaned up. Jim's answer was that \\\"the in-floor cleaning system will take care of it in a day or two\\\".\\n\\nWell, it didn't, and I emailed Steven back and asked for them to come and clean the very large amounts of bead blaster that was now covering the bottom of my (now filled) pool. That stuff is heavy and the in-floor system just doesn't have the power to remove it. And even if it did, it would just go into the pool filter and clog the heck out of it. And we all know pool filters are a pain to clean.\\n\\nSteven never responded and suffice to say I had to figure out a way to clean the stuff myself; the only option ended up being buying a robotic pool cleaner, that I literally had to run every day for TWO WEEKS to get all of the bead blaster out. Besides the hassle, those robotic pool cleaners aren't cheap. I had no need for a robotic cleaner until they filled my pool with bead blaster.\\n\\nIf that wasn't enough, I later also found a huge pile of bead blaster that had been left in a corner of my backyard, \\\"hidden\\\" underneath some gravel. That has been equally a pain to remove, since you can't just hose that stuff off (it's extremely hard to get rid of).\\n\\nSo in the end, in spite of Steven and Jim's initial friendliness, they basically left me with a huge mess to clean up and more expenses. Had I known what I know now I would have definitely gone with somebody else, or done the job myself and saved both time and money."}

Roomier seats than expected and the outlets and wifi are a nice touch.  \\n\\nI loved that I could get to Pittsburgh in about 4 hours and 20 minutes with a brief stop in Erie.  There were a variety of times offered and many times I was able to have the seat next to me to myself.  \\n\\nOne of the problems is that the bus was coming from Toronto.  If there were any border delays, the bus could be up to an hour late.  One trip it was almost two hours!And you would get NO information from customer service.  In fact, they were often rude and disrespectful towards you.  In today's connected world there should be no reason that customer service can't be kept up to date about the status of a bus.  \\n\\nThe Toronto-Buffalo-Erie-Pittsburgh route no longer exists which I don't quite understand because every time I took it, it was at least 3/4 full.  The worst experience I had was when I received notificaiton my trip leaving Pittsburgh at 11:15 p.m. on a Sunday night was cancelled.  I tried calling to get additional information and was told \\\"it must be weather related\\\"  Except the trip was still two weeks away!  It turned out they had cancelled some of the trips between Buffalo and Pittsburgh (and eventually eliminated the route) but again, that is something that customer service should have been aware of.  \\n\\nLong story short, the bus trip itself is enjoyable and worth the price (especially since the cost of a round trip ticket is generally less than  it would cost to fill up your gas tank) but lots of luck if you actually have to deal with customer service."}

When you walk in, the hotel lobby is fairly modest, once again, nice...but nothing to rave about.   When we checked into the room, it's a nicely done average room.  The bathroom was pretty small, but then again very clean, so no complaints there.   Indoor pool was pretty small as well, but sufficient.  All in all, hotel and it's amenities were pleasant but blah.   Now the one thing that makes this hotel all worth it?  Location, location, location.  It's right above the train station, with easy access to the Metro down below, as well as straight access to the Underground City.   If you want to ride topside, there's a bus stop right at the corner of the church outside the hotel.   You could go anywhere you want, the public transportation is very very good.  It's also walkable distance to Old Montreal, it's a bit far but not too bad either.  If you get a good rate, I would recommend staying here.   Hotel personnel were also very attentive.

So many veggie bins on the salad line were empty or looked less than appetizing since someone would spill other stuff into another bin. Yuck. There were tons of kids running amuck thru the line as well putting their hands on everything. One kid had an entire plate full of just boiled egg crumbles and was running up and down the line with no parents in sight. Where are the parents or management/staff to control this kind of stuff? Putting hands on everything is so unsanitary, which is why I usually stray from buffets... When paying, I was shocked at the prices now. I haven't been to a Sweet Tomatoes in about a year or so, but $28 for 2 dinners and 2 drinks at a salad bar seems way ridiculous. Another $10 or less and I could have gone to Outback and we could had some steak with our salad!\\nAfter seating we went to get drinks and I was so disappointed that their tea was empty and they dont have apple juice anymore since I am not a big soda drinker. We then ventured to get some bread and soup to go with our salad. Almost all of the soups had that crusty layer on top from sitting so long. There was no butter for potatoes or bread. The foccacia and pizza bread was just the crusty outter layer that no one ever seems to take. The pastas were crusty and dry looking. So much for my appetite. After eating our salad and little bread/muffins that weren't old looking we went in for some of their gooey chocolate cake. Again only the outside rim of it was left and it was rock hard. The guy behind the counter said it would be a while before a new one was out. He just stared at the kid who was digging around the cake and using his finger to scrape the cake off the self serve spoon. Gross. We then just settled for a dry brownie muffin and ice cream. We never did take anything from the fruit/pudding bar since that was covered in kids as well and all the bins were almost empty. \\nKnowing that I am pregnant and hormones are raging, I decided not to complain since it would probably turn out ugly with me either screaming or in tears. Just left hungry and disgusted. I will not be back to this location. Too bad the express location is closed now since I did frequent it all the time.

The dark, lofty, eclectic atmosphere was pleasant and welcome after a long day of tourism! I ordered a glass of Pino Noir and, while it was a very fine selection, it was $12.00 - a fact unknown to me until I got the check. However, it must've had a pretty high alc content because it did the job of two glasses of the crap I buy at home. We were seated upstairs in very close quarters to the tables on either side of us - don't expect privacy here. But my husband and I love people watching so we were not put off by being subjected to the DB sitting next to us trying to impress the girl we believe he met online. It was a form of entertainment. My husband spent a good 10 mins perusing the VERY extensive whiskey menu and decided on the Angel's Envy. What a treat! Truly a flavorful blend to savor slowly, first with the olfactory then orally. One can smell the unique ingredients. I plan to buy a bottle of this \\\"nectar of the gods\\\" for my boss at Christmas. It's definitely a bone warmer. We ordered a cheese tray appetizer. I was expecting a few triangles of Cheddar. What we got was a smattering of four specialty cheeses - each with opposing flavors - designed, I believe, to wake up your taste buds and remind them that there are still unique flavors in the world! My favorite thing about this tray was the sweet peach jelly infused with a touch of Mustard oil. There's a name for this lovely combination. But I forgot it. Our entree's were the Shephard's Pie and the Flank Steak. The Pie was wonderful. The meat was so tender it melts in your mouth. The flank steak was way way way too salty. I ate it all after those two $12 glasses of super charged Pinot Noir and chased it with 3 glasses of water. I don't think my Sober tongue would have done so well. Steve was a very patient, awesome, friendly server. We asked him more questions than any diner at 10pm on a Saturday night has a right to ask. We tipped him well. Overall, this is definitely a place foodies should try and meat & potato peeps like me should experience!"}

We have done table service at many similar Vegas clubs over the years, so this was not a new experience for us in general, but it was our first time at XS specifically.\\n\\nCONS\\n--We arrived at 10 pm, and despite having a reservation, still had to stand in line for 20 minutes. And I didn't have a single memorable encounter with a host - generally they were pretty unfriendly.\\n--While it was a nice evening to be outdoors, our poolside table was almost as far from the stage and dance floor as one can get.\\n--The dance floor required some other form of access which apparently our $2600 did not buy us immediate access to. However, our server told us if we wanted to hit the dance floor, we could text our host (even though we had yet to see him at any point during the evening) or we could flag her down and she would get him for us. Which leads to my next point...\\n--Our server was very friendly and I have no complaints about her personally. However, she was clearly over-assigned or otherwise occupied because we were lucky to see her every 45 minutes. She apologized each time, but it still doesn't excuse the fact that we were paying as much as we were to barely see our server throughout the night (fortunately none of us wanted that dance floor access too badly).\\n--By midnight, our table area was completely surrounded by people who had paid the minimum cover for access to the club, and they were spilling over into our space.\\n\\nPROS\\n--Blackjack tables were good.\\n--The weather was nice so it was a good night for a poolside table.\\n--The music was good.\\n--Our group of friends has fun no matter where we go, and thanks to 3 bottles of alcohol, we made the most of it.\\n\\nThis club is clearly trying to be everything to everyone - exclusive table service + large dance club.

This place only does threading and henna tattooing. \\n\\nThe shop is small and personal. It's not the most luxe of interiors, but the brisk and professional service makes up for it. Having not had the threading myself, I can only attest that they threaded out my partners beard (all of it, cheeks chin neck and mustache) in about an hour and only charged us $35 for it. We were very pleased with the results and stoked about the low cost. \\n\\nMore than a handful of stray, missed hairs and a lack of lotion or balm after the procedure keeps this rating from a 5, but so long as you can provide your own aftercare I would still highly recommend Jada Beauty.\\n\\nFor those of you who have never been \\\"threaded\\\" it's a hair removal process where hair is trapped between a twisted strand of thread and pulled out by the root.

But if you are looking for volume and sheer size, this might be the best place.\\n\\nWe have been coming to this B & N for the last five years.  All the employees are very helpful, and Four Stars in my opinion.  It's convenient for from my office and it seems as if we're in here at least twice a month on weekends.  \\n\\nI know at this point,  I am tired of the Nook sales pitch as you come through the door.  At some point, I'm sure Microsoft will just buy the other 50% they do not own and that will end it. Hopefully.\\n\\nSo in summary, this Barnes & Nobles is Thee Stars, A-OK."}

I don't think this place was made to be authentic.

Their house dressing for their salad is unique like a sweet vinegerette. Their gyoza and shrimp tempura is just like what you'll find in any Japanese restaurant.

I asked if there was anything else?  He said \\\"no\\\" and sort of shuffled out, looking at us the entire time.\\n\\nWe took the pizza into the other room and opened the box.  Now it made sense.  The pizza had been in a horrible collision as if it had been dropped and was like a ball of pizza in the corner of the box.\\n\\nI called to reconcile the problem and explained the situation, expecting we'd get a refund or the next pizza free.  The lady at the other end of the phone said this \\n\\n\\\"um... sorry.\\\"  So I said \\\"ok...\\\" To which she replied \\\"are there any other major complaints?\\\"  So I asked her to get her manager and have him call me back.\\n\\nThe manager called back and apologized and said he'd give us $2 off our next pizza.\\n\\nSo we don't get a free pizza, but if I ever order from that location again I will get a pizza that costs $23.

{"_id": 2, "text": "So many great reviews.  Friends who live or have lived in Pittsburgh rave about this place.  It was supposed to be THE PLACE for breakfast and brunch in this city.  I first visited this place on a short Pgh Apt hunting trip back in April 2013.  Went in, got excited, as the place was packed with people.  It had the classic diner feel.  It had to be good.  Sadly, it wasn't.  Not wanting to give up hope, I went back to Pamela's the next day, and went with the corned beef hash, since many yelpers had mentioned it.  Again, disappointed.  Having settled in Pgh for a few months now, I decided to give Pamela's a third chance recently.  *sigh.  I don't get how this place has such high yelp ratings.\\n\\nFood = (6.5/10) = As mentioned above, my first visit I tried the western omelet.  It was just ok.  Not well seasoned, and the cheese was meh.   Quantity wise, you do get a huge amount of food for what you pay for.  Second trip was the corned beef hash trip.  Really don't understand what is so great about this dish.  My third trip I tried the tex-mex omelet.  Again, eggs under seasoned, and cheese was meh.  What bothered me the most was the \\\"guacamole.\\\"  It's more like avocado paste with mayonnaise consistency.  Like something you would squeeze out of a toothpaste tube. Texture was not appealing.  The friend who came with me on this third trip ordered the pancakes, which he thought were fine.\\n\\nAmbiance = (7.5/10) = it's got the classic diner feel, with diner friendly waitresses/waiters.  \\n\\nService (8.0/10) = as mentioned above, the classic diner friendly environment.\\n\\nOverall opinion = I wonder if those who give high ratings to this establishment, are the locals of Pgh, and college/grad students on a budget and naturally appreciate the large quantities of food for cheap prices.  This place is just ok for me.  I'm still searching for my go-to-brunch place in Pittsburgh.  I do recommend trying this place out and making your own judgement, especially if you've just moved to the area.  There is always a wait to get in on weekends, so they must be doing something right.  Place is cash only."}

We got there early, and waited while they brought the food to the steamtables - it must have been cold, since they were just carrying the metal pans and setting them in to warm up.  Then, when we finally got to eat - well, everything (except the chicken, which was swimming in sauce) was dry.  Dry ribs, dry brisket.  The brisket was also fatty and tasteless.  No real flavor to any of the meat.  Pulled pork was flavorless.  I guess they cook the meat, and then since they have a pan of barbecue sauce at the end, you're supposed to add all the sauce yourself.  How is that barbecue? It was way overpriced for the quality of the meal.  The only good thing was the coleslaw and cobbler, and that's not worth $13 a person."}

Sushi as cheap as $1 and $2!\\n\\n2. QUALITY!  I've been here countless times and  I've never ever had a bad meal. Everything is top notch and high quality. Sushi bar reinforces this: you see all the sushi chefs preparing rolls in plain sight.\\n\\n3. VEGETARIAN SUSHI!!! Yep, that's right. Ru San's has a huge menu, but my favorite part is the big vegetarian section. Big list to choose from, anything from fried cream cheese maki rolls to tamago egg maki rolls to kimchi cabbage maki rolls. And basically most vegetables you can think of, all prepared in a perfect little roll... heaven! This is such a relief from most sushi restaurants who have ONE vegetarian sushi option (which is usually way overpriced). Most of the veg options are between $2 and $3... awesome! \\n\\nI really love the Eggplant Sesame Yaki. I usually order this as an appetizer and reserve the leftover sauce as a dip for some of my maki rolls. This dish has cubes of eggplant, seared perfectly, tender inside, light crisp outside. The wow factor here though is the sauce, it's a thick, peanut butter like sauce, tart and sweet and nutty, with sesame seeds.  You've gotta try this! \\n\\nIf you have room for dessert, make sure you order some Tempura Ice Cream. This is basically a block of vanilla ice cream, covered in sweet tempura batter and deep fried. Then drizzled with a strawberry (and sometimes chocolate ) sauce. I'm not sure how they keep the ice cream from totally melting, but this dessert will make your day... heck, it'll make your week. Hands down my favorite dessert of all time.\\n\\nCocktails? Order the Lady Killer... kiwi juice and sake. mmm!\\n\\nKudos for being open a little later than most places."}

Well we did go when the weather wasn't too hot. It would be killer during the summer. There are free shuttles that will take you to the strip too.\\n\\nThe fitness gym is a little small, but everything that you need is in there. The spa and fitness employees were very helpful and kind. The gym was always neat and water and juice were always refilled.\\n\\nIf I were to go back to Las Vegas, I would definitely stay at the Rio. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay!!"}
{"_id": 4, "text": "So glad we found this little gem that just opened in the heart of Scottsdale. We brought our dog here for the first time over the weekend and in doing so have found a new go-to place for not only grooming but for pet food, goodies and toys!\\n\\nUpon entering Wag N' Wash we were greeted with smiles, hellos and and a first timer tour of the building. Our primary reason for going was to utilize their self-wash setup. We chose the ultimate wash which includes an upgraded soaping machine, leave-in conditioner, cologne, brushes, towels, drying, etc...Our pup isn't the easiest dog to bathe but it was certainly an easier experience here than struggling with him in the bathtub at home! While we only have used this option, it seems a good idea to spend the extra $4 and upgrade to ultimate wash!\\n\\nAfter Dexter was clean as a whistle (and smelled good to boot) we roamed around the store. They offer a variety of toys and collars that you would not normally find in a Petsmart type store. They also have an in-house kitchen/bakery that offers homemade treats and goodies for our four-legged friends. We're looking forward to ordering a birthday cake for our little man this fall!\\n\\nOther than the self-wash, another main draw of this store is their selection of food. They offer a huge selection of lesser known but wholesome and nutritious foods you find rarely at the large pet stores. Steve, one of the owners, took the time to talk to us about our pup's health and nutrition. He offered us organic and natural solutions to what otherwise has been a situation where our dog has be on prescription foods and supplements. As a pet-parent that encourages a grain-free diet and doesn't want to pump my kids full of unnecessary remedies, I really appreciated Steve's knowledge and advice in the matter. \\n\\nYay, Wag N' Wash! We can't wait to come back and visit. We'll work on his jumping habits before Dexter comes back :)"}

The whole restaurant seems to move at it's own pace. It's a little slow - the time between people checking on your table, the wait for drinks, time between order and food arrival - but it's not terrible, it is what it is and it seems to fit the slow rotation of the restaurant.\\nThe food was great. Not incredible hence not 5 stars. My duck was meh... was better with the sauce intended for the beef. But the steak was amazing... melt in your mouth greatness.  The free-range chicken was delicious as well, a tad too much cheese inside but the taste more than made up for it.\\nTotally recommend going."}

They also didn't have any sugar for their tea. It took quite a while for the rolls to be made as well. The service was very spacey - like the guy didn't know what he was doing.\\n\\nHOWEVER, their roll (rainbow roll) was AWESOME and their green tea was TO DIE FOR. They don't serve any white fish (at least they didn't when I was there). I would definitely recommend this as a place to pick up a good lunch, but not as a date or a dinner meal."}

{"_id": 0, "text": "I am a huge fan of the Chipotle brand and food. This negative review is for the service I received this afternoon at this location.\\n\\nEarliest pickup time available when we submitted our online order was 1:15pm. We arrived 15 minutes early, was told that our order was not ready and would be about 10 minutes. We tried to pay when there wasn't a line of customers and were told that we could not pay until our order was fulfilled. The girl in charge of the pickup orders came out and told us it would be another 10 minutes. She came out with our order at 1:15pm on the dot, and told us in an exasperated tone to call next time if we would be arriving early. Her attitude was terrible, as if we were a HUGE inconvenience and had rushed her (which, obviously, we hadn't since our order came out right on time...). A simple, \\\"Sorry for the wait, I was backed up on other orders and couldn't get this out earlier for you\\\" would've sufficed. \\n\\nWhat's even BETTER is that when we mentioned pick-up-girl's attitude, the manager followed up with the same answer, \\\"next time call ahead if you'll be arriving early\\\" without so much as a hint of apology. Clearly WE were in the wrong here. It was definitely a missed opportunity on the manager's part to turn the situation around and save our experience from being so disappointing. Coming from a background in retail and fast food, I was baffled by their self-righteous, unapologetic attitudes.\\n\\nI also didn't understand why 1. the manager was working in the fulfillment line the whole time and 2. there were periods of time when there were no customers to help - whey didn't someone (like, ahem, the manager) go and help the girl filling pickup orders?\\n\\nI've never had a bad experience at Chipotle before today, and will definitely never come back to this location."}

{"_id": 2, "text": "I do love this store. I have a coworker and her condo looks amazing, which she told me she decorated it almost entirely with things from this store.  I love their accent pillows, currants, candles, etc.  Seems to me like more of a store you go to for adding decor and accent type of things.  So if you purchased a living room set somewhere else and wanted to add cute pillows, lamps, throw blanket, rug, and curtains, then you could come here.\\n\\nThe down side is this place is expensive.  I found the perfect shade of navy blue curtains here I couldn't find anywhere else.  Exactly what I envisioned so it was hard changing my mind about anything, but they were hundreds of dollars for curtains.  Perhaps that's the standard, I wouldn't know because everywhere I've lived always came with blinds and I recently bought my first home that was set up for curtains.  But I feel like for $200 I could add a few hundred more on for wood blinds at another store that would last me many years.\\n\\nMy coworker ended up finding some beautiful silver lanterns that were between $60-$140 each piece and they weren't that big.  Considering the hefty cost she turned them away which was smart to do.\\n\\nAnother reason I just gave them 3 stars and not more is I've been here about 2 times on my own, 6 times with friends and not once has a store worker ever approached us to ask us if we needed help with anything.  In fact, I'm honestly not sure what the workers look like because I really can't remember seeing anyone there.  Do they wear street clothes, business attire, uniforms? I really don't know.  Not that I like being harassed, stalked, annoyed, and followed while shopping with workers giving me their unwanted opinions about what I should buy.  But it doesn't hurt to make an appearance after 15 minutes to make sure the customer doesn't need anything."}

Not many places still have dinner meal for less than $7 with 2 sides and a tea (their dinner specials come with tea). \\n\\nFood is typical.  Grilled pork chop is a little dry and tough. Better off with the fried pork chop. And when I said pork chop I meant super thin cut ones.  Country fried steak's gravy was the whitest I have ever seen... Thus a little bland.  It reminds me of comfort food people referring to when they talk about their grannies. Nothing against grannies (or moms), but I have found out in the 2 decades I have lived in the south that their cookings are normally pretty plain and non-eventful. But knowing so still doesn't stop us from wanting granny's pot roast because it is the consistency and thoughts and memories that matter.

Think I Would Rather Suck Down Your Colonoscopy Bag?\\n\\nIf you are truly looking for a unique dining experience accompanied with old world business cards and lifeless animals, then you will need to try out Texaz Grill all for yourself. If you are looking for good food, solid service, and a nice atmosphere, then you probably want to avoid this strip mall hangout at all costs. If you love low-quality food, poor service, and a revolting atmosphere, then you need to steer your lifted F350 right on over to Texaz Grill.\\n\\nWow, from the moment we walked in I knew we were in for trouble ... I just didn't think it could be as bad as it actually was. This is one establishment that will leave you wondering whether the city of Phoenix mandates any sort of cleanliness or health standards. This place is dirty, vile, unkempt, and this is way before we even met our server or received our food.\\n\\nJust 7:30 PM on a Thursday night, but you would have thought this place was closing up shop for the night or permanently (which wouldn't be a bad thing). Guests are sparse and the few who do remain look like they have chain smoked all of taste buds right out of their mouths. The servers give you the impression they are NOT working for tips and really make no attempt at ensuring a pleasant guest experience. The inside will remind you of a cross between a real, small town BBQ joint and a TGIFridays minus the corporate cleanliness standards. The booths are ancient, uncomfortable, and anything but clean. The walls are littered with business cards, dead animals, used hats, and license plate frames. You will want to write off all the dirt and disaster on the wall as good old Texas charm, but you will quickly realize your appetite fades as each minute passes you by.\\n\\nSo we arrive at our booth and are quickly greeted by our degenerate server who you would have thought was being paid by number of tables she turned over per night. She doesn't look like she wants to be there, and, frankly, neither do we. Our drinks are brought out in a timely fashion, and then she did the best she could to get us to order a quickly as possible. And, we're off....\\n\\nOrders are put in for a Chicken Fried Steak and the Thursday night BBQ sampler. Our server had to check that there were any of the BBQ samplers left which should tell you that this combination was probably made yesterday and has been hanging around all day. The salad came quick - too quick. Within two minutes of ordering, I had the misfortune of choking down a brown, bland, and boring salad. Of course, nobody goes to a BBQ joint for a salad, but I think most prefer green lettuce and more than two dressing choices.  Not even ten minutes later and our entrees had arrived, and we suddenly had enough food to feed an entire homeless shelter but I have my doubts of them even touching this piss poor attempt at Texas BBQ.\\n\\nChicken Fried Steak - imagine about 1oz of beef shankle meat breaded in a pound of breading and smothered in some alien gravy. The meat was bland, veiny, chewy, and not even good enough for my neighbor's dog. You get two of them and each one will be bigger than your head, but I'm not really sure what you are supposed to do with them because they are anything but edible.\\n\\nBBQ Sampler - I would have rather have sampled what was soaked up in the dirty bar rag or growing out of the rug. The ribs were too fatty and smothered in the generic BBQ sauce that made this place famous. The brisket was boring and overcooked. The Texas fries were not fries, nor were they good. The sausage was edible, but more so in a comparative way. Even the bread was terrible.\\n \\nThe food can be summed up as atrocious, inedible, poor quality, and even hard to look at. Truly some of the worst food I have ever eaten or looked at in my entire life. The highlight of the night was easily when our server seemed astonished we refused the to-go box. Sorry, but you should have been shaking our hands for even trying to make a meal out of those make-me-want-to-go-vegetarian plates of meat. \\n\\nIt is worth mentioning that Texas Grill does two things and two things only correctly. You will be seated quickly to ensure that the dead animals or the plethora of 1970s business cards stapled to the walls don't scare you away and the plastic soft drink mugs are gigantic, but I'm sure this was implemented to minimize server interaction with the tables.\\n\\nGo grab a McRib or two before you throw away any money at this place...or be ready to pop some serious laxatives. Outside of some rough drinking nights, I have never felt the urge to vomit all over the place 15 hours after a meal. Good luck to you if you choose this place. If you do decide to go, don't forget to bring your business card - it might be old enough to go up on the wall in 2032 - that is, assuming this place is around much longer."}

{"_id": 2, "text": "Oh man, if only I could do 2.5 stars here.  Let me explain:\\n\\nI attended a bachelor party meal here with a large group of dudes.  13 to be exact.  While the food was very good (I had the crab cakes, everyone else had steak - but everyone said the steak was quality), there was a vital service error that I thought was handled the wrong way.\\n\\nLet me first clearly state that my crab cakes were damn good, and so were the sides of green beans with pancetta and mashed potatoes.  The food was 4-stars-good, albeit overpriced.\\n\\nOur waiter was a good guy and he did a good job overall, BUT... one guy's steak was either really overcooked or they just plain forgot it...I really can't remember which happened, but that is irrelevant.  Anyway, they told him they would get him a new one in just a few minutes.  They then came out and shot him straight saying that cooking a new steak at this point would take more than a few minutes.  They asked if he wanted something else that might cook a little faster, and the Victim stated he would take some crab cakes.\\n\\nHere is where they went wrong.  They gave him a free drink for his troubles.  I don't know if this waiter had any control over this situation, but to me... with a group of 13 people at a special occasion like this, you should be getting that entree for free.  He didn't want crab cakes, he wanted steak... and they screwed up and there was no way for him to be eating his entree even close to the same time as the other 12 people at that table.  If you're at the level of pricing that a restaurant like this is ($36 for crab cakes, even more for the steak), there's a certain raised level of expectations for service - and they just weren't met here.  The bill for this meal was probably in the $1500-2000 range... they should've taken the $50 hit to make it right and give this guy his steak for free.  Maybe that just isn't done at places like this... I can't say I go to them regularly enough to gauge something like that.\\n\\nNo other complaints, the waiter was good overall... I just think The Great Steak Incident Of 2014 was handled all wrong.  I wouldn't eat there again, but that's because I wouldn't regularly pay $36 for crab cakes when I can go to In N Out burger for 8 bucks.  I'm a classy gentleman."}

The manager or owner even came by at one point to ask how everything was. \\n\\nThe food was delicious, and just like others have said, there are so many things to choose from! We had three dishes from the tapas menu and combined they were plenty of food for us both. We had the duck empenadas, some kind of flat gorditas, and one of the pork belly selections.

The flavors were wonderful though, and we left very satisfied and not one regret about the price. Stop by for a fun night out!"}

Very little flavor to the dressing, could see no oregano and the garlic bread was greasy.  Co-worker was uninspired by the chicken fingers with soggy fries.  They included a free cheese pizza but it was greasy and also uninspired.  The sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce.   We won't be ordering again."}
{"_id": 1, "text": "I would like to say first that the place has good service and I know they are trying hard to create unique flavors in a strange location. Which is mildly being factored but, I have to be real and with giving a less than positive review I will give feedback that will improve it next time. \\nAccording to YELP 3 stars means \\\"Yah I am a fan\\\" and I could not give them that 3\\nI came here with a couple friends and let a non foodie friend suggest this place because it was his Bday and he heard from friends it was good... \\nWe ordered :\\n$8 ish Sweet Potato Fries with Duck Confit- This was one of the things that I kinda liked even thought the duck was dry and was presented as an almost\\\" pulled pork style\\\" What really could of improved this would of been some type of dip of sauce to go with it. Something that might reflect a confit glaze with texture. \\n\\n$10 Bacon Dates- This is something that if you are going to serve Tapas style that you do right because it is standard on any Tapas menu. The bacon was soggy and falling off and the dates were really hardly stuffed. CRISPY BACON is is critical though for this dish. \\n\\n$12 Prosciutto and Melon- UGH it should been a red flag when they misspell it on the menu and when you ask the waiter all he can say is that people come here just for the dish but doesn't have any personal opinion. So on paper it sounds like an interesting dish and it could be possible delivered but, it is difficult to do. The dish here is served with bug chunk of melon of small prosciutto slices on top with Saba drizzled and feta scattered on the plate with a poached egg. All the ingredients I love but, if this was \\\"Chopped\\\" the judges would say that you just threw them all on the plate without really combining into flavor. The melon was too big and sweet with the minimal prosciutto and the saba/feta was more on the plate than on the dish while the egg just was hard to use for anything except by itself. How can you fix this??\\n1. longer thinner melon slices turn it more into a vessel while being able to add the prosciutto as true layer of same size.\\n2. I would try a qual egg which would fit perfectly\\n3. then drizzle the saba directly with a sprinkle of feta and it is all on their like a great umami finger food. \\n\\n$9 or $10- Pork Belly Mac and Cheese- The worst thing here by far and this really can be categorized as BAD overall! Alfredo noodles, runny Alfredo Sauce, under fried pork belly and cheese on top then bake it BOOM Mac and cheese!! Oh man I can't believe this actually made it to a menu without some type of vetting. It really was not mac and cheese because all the cheese was a sauce on the bottom of part of the baked cheese on top. The pork belly was cut really small and was just fatty and mushy without any real crisping or frying. This idea is good but, actually put work into it! Make a sauce with the noodles already in it. \\n\\n$18 Alfredo Pizza- Sausage, Spinach, Sun dried tomatoes and Alfredo sauce- Super cheesy if you like think really creamy cheesy flavor which is super 1 note. Could use more spice but, this is exactly what you order is what you got. So, I can't say to change it however the crust is not very crispy and hard to eat with hands. I had to knife and fork it. \\n\\nSo overall I am not saying don't go here, food choices in Chandler are fairly limited and I assume if you are really into wine you can ignore my review since this is food related. I am just saying the food needs major improvement and the prices are set for something much more high end than what you are getting."}

It is very clear that no one working there wants to put any effort into meeting your needs. I called ahead of time and asked to get adjacent rooms, but the person on the phone basically said that someone else in the hotel assigned rooms and they were unable to until we checked in. Our flights got delayed the first night and when we arrived we were informed that there were no more queens available (even though I booked 2 rooms with 2 queen beds, with 4 guests per room, and had called earlier that day). We were forced to take king beds, and the person checking us in told us to come by in the morning and we would be moved to queens and comped for the disservice. My sister called in the morning and was told by someone that there were no more queens available and there was nothing they could do for her (even though the guy promised us the night  before...).

(it was rare for them to have more than 2-3 people working the front desk... laughable). Their computer system also appears to be one giant joke and was the main reason everything took so long.

{"_id": 1, "text": "So I kept hearing so much about the Country Club Grill at the Wynn and I have been extremely eager to dine there for a while. I mean there are murmurs that this place Steve Wynn's favorite place in the hotel so this really has to be a knockout of a place right? You wouldn't waste the view overlooking the entire golf course with something mediocre right? This is the Wynn which is supposed to be the Las Vegas best of the best RIGHT?\\n\\nSadly wrong on all counts and lets just say I was thoroughly let down. So much so I have turned 2 people away from eating here already. Look if I ruin how I feel about the meal this early in the review you have to know it was just that lackluster...\\n\\nSo I made a reservation as it was advised this place can get very busy and it was a Friday afternoon. I walked in and was greeted pleasantly by the team at the front podium and was sat very promptly.  My table was at the glass and no matter where you sit you have a great view of the entire Wynn golf course.  The chairs were even real comfy which was just a great sign that they wanted to think every detail through of your dining experience. Things were looking up, right?\\n\\nOur waiter came and dropped of the menu and an option vegan menu. It took me a second but, then I realized there was no wine or drink menu. I asked the waiter for this and it was brought over in a relatively timely manner. The actual menu is simple and covers pretty much every option you would expect for lunch dining with more than 3 items on it that looked good. When the waiter came back we ordered a nice white wine from France to get things started. This is sadly where things started to slide downhill. The waiter pinged back and forth a few times before I waived him down and gave him my food order (for me tomato & mozzarella salad and the chicken club sandwich). After a while of wondering where my wine was the waiter informed us that they didnt have what was ordered and brought a bottle of something from Oregon and a different varietal. Now let me stop here if I was at the Olive Garden this wouldnt be a big deal but the reputation and more importantly the PRICE of this place means they are held to a higher standard. The bottle was declined and I asked for an alternate on the menu. The waiter seemed confused. The wine list isnt very long so knowing whats on it should not be that hard.\\n\\nNow the first course came out (salad for me and soup for my companion) and I was eager to try the food. Sadly another let down as my salad was just bland. I had to waive down the waiter for salt as there was none on the table. So up until this point if you read my review you might think I was real picky and just kind of a harsh critic but, really what it comes down to is again at this price level you have certain expectations and they were being dragged down in a very fast fashion. Finally the wine was brought out and I was able to enjoy it alongside my food. And that is when my waiter disappeared for about 15 minutes. So whenever I ran out of wine I had to reach over and do it myself.\\n\\nThe main course came out from the kitchen which looked amazing and we were still having to constantly refill our own wine. Now the chicken sandwich had a real good flavor of well cooked chicken, the sauces, and the soft bread. Really this was the only positive part of the meal and its saving grace for me. My dining companion ordered an item off the vegan menu (a mushroom napoleon)  and was unfortunately let down by the flavor.\\n\\nI really cant tell you how much I wanted to like this place and maybe thats why I am so let down. Sub par service and so so food make this place a must skip as far as I am concerned. Wish that wasnt the case!"}

I love this place.\\n\\nTo address some previous reviews:\\nLocal Beers\\nThe taps change constantly, because there are a TON of breweries within 150 miles of Pittsburgh. And there's NOTHING wrong with featuring only local brews. To the guy that's posted on here, and their Facebook, and everywhere else that they should have a guest brewery: If you want beer from outside of the local area, go to any other craft beer bar in Pittsburgh. There are tons of them. The Independent Brewing Company is the ONLY bar in Pittsburgh that features ONLY local beers, and even offers ALL the locally produced spirits. \\n\\nThe Food v Cost\\nAre you people insane? Look at the various menus they've posted online on Twitter and Facebook. The cheapest thing on the menu is about $5, and the most expensive has been about $15. And this is too expensive for you for fresh made food that doesn't use frozen or manufactured food?!? Really? Everything is made fresh. By hand. No frozen fries, no prepackaged crap. And the most expensive dish I've seen was $15. You can pay more than $15 for an entree at TGIFridays. \\n\\nDecor\\nThey opened 5 days after taking control of the bar. It's previous incarnation, Fanatics, was the embodiment of every trashy Pittsburgh sports bar, with nicotine stained tin signs, neon signs, TUBE television sets hanging from the ceilings (Yes, TUBE television sets, multiples), and 30 years of dinginess. They reopened 5 days later...FIVE. No contractors, just the owners and the helping hands of close friends to make it presentable enough to open. This included a handmade mosaic with the IBC logo, great chairs, and some other minor renovations. Now the joint is covered in prints from Alternate Histories, which are hilarious. Take the time to look at them. Totally cool. And a huge selection of records....because iPhones and digital playlists are verboten.\\n\\nCocktails v Cost\\nGone are the days of $6 cocktails with rubbing alcohol quality booze, that are overly sweet, and come in a pint glass. Deal with it Pittsburghers. A good bar means good cocktails, and not just good cocktails, but inventive cocktails made with only the best ingredients. The resident Saturday night bartender, Adam Henry, has done a damn fine job of creating a cocktail program for the bar. Not only can you get delicious bottled and barreled cocktails during the week, but he's there every Saturday with some of the most interesting cocktails in the city. Dry ice, emulsification, liquid nitrogen, obscure ingredients, and some really great presentation. Don't believer me? Order the London Fog, or the Sex Panther. Even if you don't see it listed on the chalkboard. Just make sure you're sitting at the bar.\\n\\nAnd for those of you wondering, I'm not an owner, or friend of the owner put up to writing this review. I've just gone enough to write a proper review, and thought it might be helpful to have all the info. Thanks for taking the time to read it!"}

{"_id": 1, "text": "I have been a HUGE fan of Cafe Rio and went to the Gilbert location many many times when I lived in the East Valley.  I would actually drive more than 10 miles each way to get there I enjoyed it so much.  \\n\\nOnce I heard they were opening a location on my new end of town I was thrilled to say the least.  It was going to be my new regular place to go for Mexican food each week.  \\n\\nWell......that is not exactly the way it turned out. \\n\\nI've been 3 times since they opened and have had identical experiences each time so I write this review in confidence that I did not simply just catch them on a bad day.  \\n\\nEach time the line to get through was painfully slow.  The last time there were about 10 people in front of us and it took more than 20 minutes (yes I timed it) for us to be served.  I'm not amused by their singing in the least.  That does not show me that the staff is enjoying their shift.  In fact, they seemed stressed,  grumpy, and less than enthusiastic about interacting with customers.  \\n\\nI'm willing to bet a big reason for that is the fact that they were understaffed each time.  Only 2 people working the front line?  Come on Cafe Rio. You guys are too busy to only have 2 people up front on the make line.  They did not have a runner refilling the bins either; not surprising that they were out of nearly everything.  Hey management/ownership, you are stressing your workers out and aggravating your customers by making us wait that long.  \\n\\nOnce we navigated the line and survived the slow service, we get to the end where we were asked if we wanted guacamole on our nachos.  They only had a tiny bit left, and they put that on top.  We looked at them and said, is that all you have?  We were told they would bring some more out soon.  When we slid over to the register and the girl at the register said that was the normal amount and if we wanted any more it would be an additional charge. So, they charged the $2.50 (or so) for it and said they would bring it out to us.  \\n\\nBy this point we are bugged and not enjoying our experience and were discussing how cheap they have become nickel and diming people.  In this case, an extra $2.50.  then they brought us out a little 2 oz cup of guacamole.  $2.50 for that?  Hardly....we took it back inside and got our money back for that.  I know food is not cheap and good food really is not cheap, but come on, stop being so chincy, CR. \\n\\nI've just noticed the meat portions have become smaller, the prices have gone up, the service has gone south, and now we are no longer loyal customers."}

At the time I thought \\\"gee, that guy seems grumpy\\\" until I had my own unpleasant experience with the office staff as I was leaving. I went in to establish myself as a new patient and get an annual physical which is covered by my insurance but the next thing I know they submitted it as a particular ailment and told me I owed them money!  I explained that they submitted it wrong and it should be covered and that's when the nasty staff gloves came off.  They were yelling at me, telling me they didn't have to provide me with information they provided to my insurance, didn't have to provide me with my visit information, etc.  The doctors heard this crazy conversation that the nasty office staff was having and not one of  them came out to apologize or stop the problem.  In the meanwhile the staff started hurling personal insults and being condescending to me.  I left the office in tears and got a letter a week later 'firing' me as a client (not that I was planning on ever going back).   No doctor is worth being treated like this by staff....and it made me realize why the man I saw while waiting was irate. It wasn't just me."}

There were a ton of employees who were always asking if I was doing ok while I was walking around the store. Their prices are a little higher, but then they do have some things that are unique only to their store. I researched online before coming in and I had my eye on a specific body pillow. When I finally got to the pillow section, they had the body pillow I wanted, but that's it. Nothing else to compare it to. I asked an associate walking by if this was the only body pillow they had because I wanted to compare the one I wanted to others. He said that they had a sad selection of body pillows and that other customers had asked before for a bigger selection. He did reassure me that my choice was a good one and that it was soft but firm enough to support my body. I love that they send coupons in the mail, so it saved me $4. I bought the pillow and indeed, it is what I was looking for. I know I'll frequent BB&B only if I'm looking for a specific something."}

Keep in mind the date.. June. We asked our server if she could do something about the temperature. She said that she was comfortable and that there was nothing they could do. I watched every other person on the aisle ask simliar questions regarding the temperature and she told them the same thing. I'm sorry, but if everyone is saying that it is too cold you need to make some sort of effort to change it. The food is always good to me, just be forewarned that it does take a while. They drop the check off 45 minutes before the movie is over, but if it's a crowded movie, be prepared to wait in a wrapped around line for you credit card back. After complaining to the manager, she said there was nothing she could do. My advice to movie goers at cinebarre:\\n1. bring your winter jackets and long johns.. even in the dead of summer.\\n2. don't come hungry or thirsty.. get your drinks at the bar BEFORE walking in the theatre if you can.\\n3. bring a little flashlight if you enjoy seeing your food while you eat it.\\n4. pay with cash... better yet.. just eat before you go to cinebarre.\\nMy advice to Cinebarre:\\n1. hire more staff for busier movies.\\n2. TURN DOWN THE TEMPERATURE!  I don't care if your staff is comfortable.. your patrons are NOT (especially if they complain and say they are not).\\n3. and if patrons do complain about their experience.. try to make it up to them somehow.. a free popcorn or even a heart felt apology would've been better then nothing.\\nGREAT concept.. terrible execution. won't ever go back or recommend to anyone else. my toes are still freezing."}

They preferred to come out during the week. Sorry, but not everyone can take off work for an estimate. And, then for an estimate to be done, they charge $25.00. Why do you charge someone a fee to give a quote? Yes, they return it if you go with them, but absolutely absurd to charge someone a fee to get business. It is the cost of getting new business. So, they just came out today to give an estimate and a small China cabinet (5'X3') would cost over $1875.00 to do. Ridiculous! Save your $25.00 estimate fee and go somewhere else on YELP.

While this place offers many different types of tacos, the star here is the tacos al pastor. I can safely tell you that this is probably the best taco I have ever had in my life.

But 'nice' also applies to your friend's boring girlfriend, or the jumper your gran gives you at christmas and is desperate to hear your opinion of. \\n\\nFirst off, I think it's really cheeky when restaurants charge you for a basket of bread.

For that price i could have bought myself a glass of wine, and i know which one of the two i'd have preferred!\\n\\nWe were ordering from the 'Du Vin Or Not Du Vin' menu, which gave us the choice of 2 courses for \\u00a310 a head, or 2 courses with wine for \\u00a315 a head.

In the ten days since we ate there, I've completely forgotten what we even had as a starter - read into that what you will.\\n\\nLong story short, I ended up paying almost \\u00a350 for a meal that they make you think will cost \\u00a330. More annoyingly, it was a meal that I could have got in pretty much any of the half dozen pubs within 20 metres of here, for a fraction of that price and with much better atmosphere.

Literally, it feels like you cross the border and are in Mexico proper when you enter the store.  For a white guy like myself, it's fascinating, if not a little disconcerting.  Oh, how I prayed for an aisle of lucha libre masks. \\n\\nThe time I broke down and had to pick up something from the store, which in shortening the description, was a \\\"cluster\\\".  I don't know what happened, but it had the full Mexican grocery store packed to capacity vibe I had experienced in Tijuana shops.  I've never had to fight so hard to move around.\\n\\nI had to buy some cough drops, and asked one of the floor staff.  He turned to me and smiled, letting me know that he had no idea what I was saying.  But he took me to the front, so I could talk to a cashier.\\n\\nHe said something to her in Spanish, and she looked at me.  Apparently, English wasn't her first language, either.\\n\\nBear in mind that when I talk to someone who doesn't primarily speak English, I'm not one of those jerks who speaks to someone slowly like a small child, or a mental case.  Nor do I need to needlessly raise my voice, because obviously, speaking loudly is a sure way to get someone to understand you when they wouldn't otherwise before.  I kept it simple, clear, and to the point.\\n\\n\\\"Hi.  I'm looking for cough drops?\\\"\\n\\nSilence.  Her smile forms.\\n\\n\\\"Cough drops?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Cock drops\\\", she responded a little too innocently.\\n\\n....\\n\\nOkay, what place serves \\\"cock drops\\\"?  Really.  And whatever does, I don't want to know.  We all stood looking at each other, confusedly, before I tried again.\\n\\n\\\"Cough drops.  Medicine.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Maybe in there,\\\" she points at this locked cabinet, which had 1,000 different medicine types that I've never heard of before.  And no cough drops.  You're right there within better visual range than I am.  Can't you tell?\\n\\nI had to pick up another thing or two.  I couldn't get help because no one seemed to understand English.  I understand it's a Mexican market, so I'm walking into non-gringo territory, but if I can learn a few basic phrases in Spanish, at least have employees who can understand some basic English for when that random white dude walks in.\\n\\nBottom line, if you want to get some authentic Mexican foodstuffs, this is the place.  Prices are average to a little overpriced, but they are stocked with some unique food choices bound to make you a hit at the next barbecue.  But go on a quieter day or I guess bring a translator if you're non-Hispanic and can't find things on your own."}

However, there is no denying the sandwich is tasty and enjoyable.\\n\\nThere are few foods that encapsulates a city and are easily identifiable as a Primanti Bros sandwiches. Its as synonymous with Pittsburgh as the Steelers, the steel industry, and the Three Rivers. When ever I am in town I always swing by to grab one. I love it!\\n\\nThis sandwich's main attraction is its amalgamation of meat, cheese, coleslaw and fries. It was Epic Meal Time before EMT got big on the internets. That being said, its quite plain and, in all honesty, boring. The meats and cheeses are your standard deli meats. The slaw is pretty dull with no acid, color, or salt. The fries are, well, fries. The bread is super soft and thick, but that softness yields to the juices that can create a sloppy mess toward the end of the sandwich. Now, just when you think I'm hating on this beast, I do have to say that it tastes better than the individual components in an act of culinary synergy. This is definitely one of the places that I seek out after a late night when ever I'm in the 'Burgh.\\n\\nThe other things I don't like is that this place is cash only. I get it, but its very inconvenient. I wish I owned a restaurant that had the gravitas to be cash only, so I'm a bit jealous! The other thing is that the service is inconsistent. Some of the servers are very energetic and entertaining and very welcoming. In fact, on a recent trip, he forgot our beer when we ordered it. After reminding him we ordered beers, he gave it to us on the house. Now THAT is service! The most recent time, I walked in after my train got in to the Amtrak station at 5:30 am. It seemed that the people working there were confused that someone was in so early. It took a long time to order and an inordinate amount of time to get my food despite being one of three people in the place. Oh well, life goes on.\\n\\nAnyway, this place is an institution. A trip to Pittsburgh isn't complete without stepping into the hallowed ground of Primanti's and scarfing down a piece of Americana!"}

{"_id": 0, "text": "Store is nice and big, bright, organized. Makes me feel like an old shop based on how nothing is bagged and boarded so you have to look for a good copy which I like. \\n\\nHowever they have no ethics about pricing. I bought some comics off the new wall, not marked up at all. A woman rang me up never said a word about what these comics were being sold for, even though it wasn't marked on the books and they clearly are making up their price. So I trusted her total because I wasn't adding up what I bought before I bought it, I just knew i grabbed 10-14 comics. So I get home and see that I was charge $6.60 for a comic that every other store sells for $3.99.  Now this was an incentive comic of 1:3, but no other shop in Las Vegas or Cali has ever charged me more than $3.99 for this because 1:3 is an extremely low incentive, and cover price for the regular version is $3.99, even Velvet Undergound will charge 15% below the $3.99. \\n\\nSo I thought this was a mistake and called and asked why was I charged more than $3.99, and was told that's what the price was.  Then when I asked why wasn't it marked with that price because it's clearly their own price and not common for those books, I was told since there was no price I should have asked.  \\n\\nAnd I completely agree, it's my fault. It's my fault for not assuming I was going to be killed on the price for trying to give some business to my local shops instead of buying online like everyone else is doing nowadays. But still I do not feel this was a valid reason.  So by their pricing logic, they can just make prices up on the spot if they felt like it since nothing is marked with the correct price. Granted it's their business they can do what they like, but it was a major turn off for me to ever shop here again.\\n\\nIt would take me too long having to ask every single price before I bought a comic."}

Yet, it was also a death I am willing to experience again. I am not a huge fan of cream sauces, but I even took a few bites of the pasta. The lasagna was my favorite.

Well the only thing she could find was some cotton balls and a stick to push cuticles back oh and a file.  No clippers No cuticle cutters No nail buffer. So I'm thinking  Wow this is going to be interesting. So she filed my toenails, squirted some stuff on the cuticles put some lotion on my feet and painted my nails.  This is not the kind of pedicure I would have expected at a salon. Now onto the manicure.  She starts looking around for tools again as I tell her that my nails need cut.  She finally finds some clippers---cuts my nails, files them and paints them!  No soaking No cutting cuticles No buffing No hand massage.   Even the $10 manicures at all the walk in places do all the other stuff. Do people really pay $25 at Deegie Carmas for that kind of a manicure-I hope not.\\nI then step into my 45 min facial (that supposedly costs $85!!!)  When we left there was no mention of us calling or coming back for the blowout and at the point both of us knew we were never going back to Deegie Carmas.  Both girls were very nice but all that really didn't help us for what we went for.  Where was the manager to rectify this situation!!\\nIf Deegie Carmas was not ready to perform per the groupon that they decided to take part in then they should not have done so."}

{"_id": 0, "text": "I discovered Houston'swhile in Atlanta on business in the 90's, and have been a great fan.  After I moved to Scottsdale in 1999, I became a serious regular and found Houston's to be a 5 star experience every time.  It was a great relationship until the changes started a few years ago.  First, their wonderful Filet disapppared for awhile, unimpressive sushi was introduced, then the Shashimi Tuna Salad disappeared, and the Phoenix location was rebranded as Hillstone.  (I ate at Hillstone twice and then gave up on it...corn on the caeser salad - a southwestern Shashimi Tuna Salad - really?)  But back to Scottsdale, where I have the most history and the strongest relationship.  They had wonderful staff who, even if I wasn't around for awhile, remembered my name and nearly all of my preferences.  Every one of them have recently left.  Service now is ok, but not great.  A high level of attentiveness is a thing of the past.   Of course, over the years the prices have increased but in the last few they have really been increasing, while portion sizes on items like salads, have dwindled.  Houston's has never been inexpensive, but I am happy to pay to have the food that I want.  Therein lies the rub.  My last two visits were so bad that I am determined not to go back.  \\n\\nMy very favorite - the shashimi tuna salad - is history again.  Although the offered, if I wanted to pay the price of the $24 Flying Tuna Platter, to fix me something sort of like it, but not with the dressing or other elements that I loved.  I ordered fries, but they have lost their snap, and I had to pick little bits of fiber off of them.  The manager explained that they were burlap fibers from the bags that they use.  I didn't eat them, and was not charged for them.  I eat early, but can no longer get a baked potato at 2pm - and where did the pork chop go?  No more 1/2 glasses of wine.  So on my very last trip, not finding anything that we came for on the menu after 13 years of dining, my friend and I decided to go with the tortilla soup rather than just leaving.  It was far too salty...not something I have ever experienced at Houston's.  Of course, they did not charge us for the \\\"meal\\\".  No reason to ever go back now.\\n\\nLeaving Houston's with an empty stomach, I considered stopping at Bandera, another Hillstone property.  I quickly wrote off that idea since they've tinkered with their menu items so much that I gave up my \\\"regular\\\" status there in 2010.  \\n\\nI believe that the Hillstone Restaurant Group has made some awful choices over the past few years, making changes to long time favorites that ruin the dining experience.  Perhaps new chefs can't just leave a good thing alone or need to put their stamp on it.  I saw this in another review and couldn't stat it better - \\\"I understand menu changes happen but it was so good and so the same for so many years why do they have to switch it all up now? Pretty sure the business model was working just fine. \\\"  \\n\\nAs steep as Houston's prices have been over the years, I didn't mind paying for great food and great service.  I'll probably go in for a fillet a couple of times a year, but I'll have to wait until it's crowded at 5pm to have a baked potato with it."}

I do have to say that we had a server who gave us the utmost attention. We had been seated at some tables near the bar mid restaurant that were wobbling and driving me crazy. At the request of the party she moved us up front and center to a much better and stable seat. Much better view to see the Material girl! So our server gets 5 STARS! Not only for that reason, she kept the glasses full and kept checking in with us, and took it all in stride as we ordered at different times and all had separate checks. Very classy, wish I could remember her name. Young girl with dirty blond hair. \\n\\nThe food was pretty blah in my opinion. Bar food none too exceptional. We had nachos that were on slightly stale chips. Good size. Everyone had a burger or sandwich. As I glanced over to my friends Pulled pork it looked dry and sad left sitting on the plate. She said it was \\\"EH\\\". I ordered a Gobbler Club sandwich. It was humongous but not that tasty, pretty dry. How can you go wrong with a club but the thick cuts of turkey did not sit well with me and I didn't like it at all. Bad texture. The commercials and time with fun friends saved the experience but I wouldn't go back to eat. Just drinks and sports. I like the location. Easy to park. Close to shadyside. Madonna really was the show stopper this night and unless she performs here I most likely won't be back."}

Trust me, I am a huge football fan, but I didn't like the negative effect it had on the ambiance of the whole restaurant. You can't have a fancy steakhouse and a sports bar.

The first time, everything was excellent; they have this spicy crab/seafood soup that is soooooo good, that I kept going back for second and third and fourth....The meats were marinated just right and everything was wonderful. I walked out of the restaurant thinking I should give them 5 stars now. I came back the second time a week later b/c I want that spicy seafood soup. Guess what, no spicy soup that day. Also, I guess they put too much sugar into the kalbi, that it burned when it got onto the grill, even though the heat was medium. I looked around and realized other tables had the same problem. The sugary stuff from the kalbi got on the the grill, which created blacken burned layer and smell, which made everything tasted not so good. In conclusion, I guess the quality vary each day, so you may get great food or you may not at this restaurant. I will still visit them again. One cool thing about this restaurant is because the ceiling is so high and open, you don't get that nasty stinky smell on your clothes and body that you normally get when cooking food at your table.

I would not say anything is gourmet or jaw dropping, but you can put together almost any breakfast you can imagine reasonably enough.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, the most disappointing aspect of the breakfast is the lame 80's era hotel coffee.  Mirage -- you don't have to serve Starbucks.  Go to a local Panera or Einsteins Bagels to get an idea of what you should be serving.  Something smooth with some flavor.  Not bland weak nothingness.   You should be embarrassed at this point.\\n\\nI've read other reviews that indicate this buffet used to rule Las Vegas.  I'm not really convinced any buffet can rule much of anything.  I tried to over-rated Wynn buffet and the far superior Paris buffet and I'm simply not sold on the idea that any buffet can challenge a reasonably good restaurant.  But that's not why buffets are in Vegas.  They are there to offer cheap fast eats.  They are cafeterias with delusions of grandeur.\\n\\nThe Cravings is a decent 'cafeteria' if you will.  The sushi lacks fish, the shrimp is plump and bottomless, the coffee (again) sucks, and they'll toss you a tasty salad of your dreams.  Like I said, it's OK... for a buffet.\\n\\nThe Mirage has been good about updating itself and I think it's time my favorite affordable resort re-invent the buffet.  Scrap the silly name.  Pull the Studio 54 gold and mirrors out of the interior.  \\n\\nI'm hearing good things about what the Cosmopolitan is doing it.  Take what works and fix what doesn't over there, bring it to the Mirage.

I say, no that doesn't sound right. So she goes to talk to her manager I guess because we never saw her again. The manager comes over to our table and apologizes profusely for what happened. I'm upset because how the hell do you confuse BOCA and Turkey? I mean, really. I know some people might think how did I not know the difference. And I thought that to myself as well, but the truth is it slipped by me even though it shouldn't have. And it hurts me every time I think about it. I will never come to this Johnny Rockets again, if any of them ever again because of this experience. \\n\\nAll I can say is, if you are vegan or vegetarian, and you go to any of the Johnny Rockets, make sure that your waitress/waiter knows that a BOCA burger isn't meat.

The waiters get better looking the closer you get to the weekend, the specials a little more glamorous, and the alcohol a little tastier. \\n\\nWe went two nights in a row, and the first night ordered so much food I actually had leftovers. The pizza I ordered was good but not great, but the bruschetta we ordered as an appie was outstanding. The bread was perfectly soaked with the juices of the tomato and the olive oil, and there was a lovely little palette cleansing salad to wash it down with. The only interesting part for me was discovering the mushrooms in the tomato mix... Seriously, fungi? Never have I had that in bruschetta before. Whatev. \\n\\nLast night, the waiter forgot to bring us our palenta fries, and when I asked him to take them off our bill and not bring them, he comped them, but brought them out as a bonus. See?

The lady who picked up the phone wasn't very professional, but I was able to reserve a table. By the time we had arrived no one was present at the front to welcome us to the restaurant.

She had to check if there was an open table by the kitchen after we were told through the phone that there was one available for us. She then said \\\"sorry your table was stolen.\\\" We were hoping to receive maybe a discount on our order or perhaps receive free dessert for the inconvenience, but she just told us to sit anywhere and didn't even walk us to our table. \\n\\nAfter that rough greeting to our first time at Musashi we finally had our orders taken and we were a bummed that we couldn't have teppanyaki tonight. So we ended up ordering rolls and to our surprise they were very tasty. My personal favorite was the Party N Ur Mouth. It was a roll with deep fried banana, tuna, crab, and sweet mayo. I thought it was unusual at first but we ordered it anyway. And boy was it delicious! We had also ordered the rainbow roll and the porn star. \\n\\nAlthough we had received poor customer service, we surely enjoyed the food. I would definitely come back to try their teppanyaki.

Well, my girlfriends and I happen to be in Vegas on a Wednesday so we decided to hit up Eclipse. Since discovering Surrender's nighttime pool club, we've been a fan of that scene since. We got a $500 comped table from a host, Kwame, who was awesome btw! He got us checked in and everything ran smoothly. \\n\\nWelp, that's where it ended. Our waitress, Kelly, was awful. Awful awful lady! She didn't seem to want us there. She over poured our drinks, which I assume to get us to buy a new bottle quicker. My group of girls are all pretty petite, I think you can assume that our tolerance isn't that high. She made us 6 drinks, and the entire bottle was almost finished. You can only assume that those were some stiff drinks! Then when we found out we got charged for 8 water bottles, totaling to over $50 we were super annoyed with the fact that she was annoyed with us. She tells me, \\\"You said you wanted water.\\\" I kindly replied, \\\"Yes, I did want water, as a mixer for my vodka waters, but I did request 8 bottles.\\\" Especially at such a high price! I'm not that frugal but her attitude stunk! She made me feel cheap. Look lady, your 22% gratuity may already be included, but you can at least try to act like you're working for your money! After that, she took our whole bottle service away, just as quickly as we finished our last drop of vodka. RUDE! I've never felt so rushed and embarrassed. And the shitty thing is that her tip for her hour and a half of waiting on us, which was very minimal might I add, was over $130. \\n\\nEclipse, itself is okay. Big ordinary pool in the center so you can walk around the entire perimeter. DJ set up is at one end of the pool and the bar was opposite of that. It wasn't too visually appealing though.

Sometimes people would want to tweak dishes and my boss said absolutely no way - he didn't want the uneducated masses ruining his perfect combination of flavours.  The guy at Rapido was the same.  He said he would make any pizza we wanted for the normal pizza, but not his gourmet pizza, it just wasn't on.  \\n\\nSo we gave in and waited.  \\n\\nWhen our pizza was ready, we headed outside in the horribly dreary weather to walk 10 minutes down the road to home.  \\nUnfortunately, by the time we'd arrived, the pizza was pretty much cold.

Anyway, the pad kee mao was fine. It was on the lukewarm side, and I tasted more grease than spice. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't very good either. I took half of it home and never got around to eating the leftovers.\\n\\nBecause there are so many delicious Thai restaurants in the East End, I don't know how Thai Place is still open and doing decent business.

My husband was in town for a conference which was being held at the MGM Conference Center, so that is why we stayed here. We stayed in a standard room with two queen beds (we had friends who came up for a night) that was more than adequately sized. The bathroom is pretty average for a hotel - I must prefer the bathrooms at Aria and Palazzo.\\n\\nThe hotel is still a maze to get around and you will walk...a lot! The trek from the room elevators to the conference center is long; the walk from the elevators to the pool is long; and the walk to the sports book (especially if you are going from the pool) is long. But it's a good chance to work off all the food and booze! \\n\\nThe MGM pool complex remains one of my favorite pool areas in Vegas, even if cocktail service is sporadic and slow. At the end of September at 10:30 am it was not hard for me to snag a chair mere steps from the pool. We did not dine at any of the MGM restaurants, but we did have drinks more than once at Whiskey Down (I had several very friendly waitresses there), watched Sunday football at Centrifuge (buckets of beer for $25 and much more comfy than the sports book), and watched several sporting events at the sports book (again I had several nice waitresses there). Taxi lines were non-existent so you walked out the door and into a cab. Plus getting to and from the airport is super easy and around $10-13 depending on traffic. \\n\\nAs a tip, if you are heading out to walk the Strip or just want to buy cheap beer without paying $8+ for it or gambling, walk to the sports book, make a right, and go out the doors in that area. There is a convenience store when you walk out where you can get $3.50 24 oz cans of beer to take with you while walking. Also it's a good shortcut to get directly onto the Strip."}

{"_id": 2, "text": "I don't stay at Sheratons very often. Never been a big fan. I stayed here because it was the best hotel in the area given I was using points on this rare occasion. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I understand from my friends who live in Phoenix that the hotel is situated in a fairly seedy part of town. However, if you stay within the hotel and not walk around the area I think it is fine.\\nMy room was very nice for the points and supplemental price I paid. I had a lovely view of the pool which I visited during my stay. The pool was good. The only suggestion I have is that it should have been serviced by someone to pick up glasses and such left on the tables so someone else could use them.\\nFor lunch I had room service which was the fish tacos. I think that was the best meal I have ever had in room service. At a Sheraton in Phoenix! Amazing. I had dinner that evening at the hotel with a friend of mine. This was on Saturday, October 25th. The service we received was so disappointing. The food was fine but our server could not have been more lackluster. I would also say that was the case with the bellmen who took my bags at check in. I have never had anyone to be in such a hurry (it wasn't busy at all) that they had to take the bags before I even finished the check in process. It would have been nice if he had waited and walked up with me and showed the features of the room. I had the occasion to see him later and mention my thoughts and it was clear this was a nice young kid who had never been properly trained.\\nOverall, I would say this hotel is a solid 3. Much better than I had expected. I would stay here again."}

Lady who did it for me ruined all of my nails! Now they look horrible - all scratched basically with no even surface and feel like sand paper, makes me wanna cry:( It was my first time having gel nails done and I did not know what's the proper procedure to remove it (now I obviously do as I googled it), she drilled it off basically after soaking them in acetone for no more than 1 second !!! I was asking 'I think it is ruining the nail?' the lady with broken English assured that it is ok... I was hoping that the horribly looking surface of my nails is still some left stuff from the gel base when she told me that it's done and I can go! I was shocked! Tried to say it's all damaged and it shouldn't be like that, lady again said 'oh now you will have to wait until it grows back cause u had gel it won't be normal'. This is unacceptable!!! \\nlastly, the staff wasn't friendly at all and I've been charged extra for using my debit card, but this is not important at all.. my nails are ruined.\\nNever ever going back there, and I wouldn't send my worst enemy there.\\n\\nP.S.

Todd was extremely accommodating and polite whereby he immediately dispatched a service rep named Craig to change out the tumblers. Craig was  very competent and my daughter was very pleased with his work ethic. The price quoted by Todd was very reasonable (at least compared to California rates!). My whole transaction took place over the phone including  payment by credit card.

{"_id": 1, "text": "It pains me to write this review, because I went to their location on Mont-Royal right when it opened and the experience was great. This location is a different story. I went with three friends a few nights ago and sat on the terrace. Because St Catherine is closed to vehicles at this time of year down there, it was a really great experience to sit out there. The food was ok -- but the service was dreadful. We all got the table d'h\\u00f4te which is $24 for salad, pizza, non-alcoholic drink, and dessert. A good deal! Long story short, the salads never came and ended up being served with the pizza (not a huge deal), then we never saw the server again. Half our table was cleared at a certain point, but about 30 minutes after that we decided just to go inside to pay. At the register, we reminded her that we had dessert with our meals and she laughed, saying she had totally forgotten. As we paid, she piped chocolate icing into to-go plastic cups and handed them to us. Strange! I actually think their pizza is pretty good -- so I recommend it -- but strongly suggest going to a different location."}

Lots of flat-screen TV's as well, and unless you go on karaoke night, it's hardly ever crowded.  You can eat (the food is good) and you can smoke (since they're affiliated with the restaurant upstairs which doesn't let you smoke they can get away with that).  But, when there are other bars in the area that charge $2 for a beer 24/7 and you're charging $3 for a beer during happy hour and even more outside happy hour, it's kind of a deal killer."}

I sort of liked the Aladdin, and have NEVER liked any Planet Hollywood restaurant.  To me they're glorified Applebees, and I couldn't imagine the train wreck they would unleash on the former Aladdin space.\\n\\nHey, I can admit when I'm wrong.  This is one of those times.\\n\\nThe casino is slick and hip, done in black, red, and metallics.  It's totally different than most casinos with their crazy carpet and millions of colors (I'm looking at you, Bellagio...you too, Wynn).  PH's casino is almost understated - even the tables look sleek with their black felt tops.\\n\\nAs for the rest of the hotel, I did stay here when it was the Aladdin and really liked our room - it was enormous for the price, and had a large bathroom to match.  I also enjoyed the pool, but can't comment on how that's changed.  The shopping has remained pretty much the same since the switch, although now it's called the Miracle Mile instead of Dessert Passage.  It's still not as great as the Forum Shops...Miracle Mile has typical stores that can be found in any mall in America."}

Only... they only had one of seven seasonal beers.  O-kaaaayyyyy...  so I guess that means they have 32 beers\\n\\nHow about...?  Nope.  The next half dozen choices we came up with, they didn't have.  So in actuality they had AT THE MOST 26 beers.  Our problem was that the rest of the beers we could choose from we had already had (or they were IPAs, and that's a beer designed by people who hate beer), and we wanted to try something new.  The waitress was very apologetic, and we finally found one we could live with. \\n\\nWe only ordered an appetizer, the dirty chips.  Tasty, and even if you think you don't like chicken livers, don't worry -- they're fried and don't taste much like liver, and there's only four pieces around the side, so you don't even have to eat them if you don't want to.\\n\\nAt some point someone whom I assume was the manager came over to apologize for the lack of beers (I THINK he said something about changing the beers and menu hadn't changed yet???) -- but he also did something that turned this from a slam review to a \\\"you know, I'd go there again, and tell people to try it out.\\\"  He comped the beers we had, and asked if we would like to try something else.  We thanked him and told him there wasn't anything else we wanted to taste.  But he came up with a Belgian that sounded good -- but instead of the little tastes we thought he'd bring over, he came with two full sized glasses (it was a tasty beer, too!), which were also comped.\\n\\nThings go wrong sometimes, but how you handle it makes all the difference.  This was deft handling!\\n\\nI say try the place out.  It's a great place for a little bit of food, some good beer, and great vibe."}

{"_id": 2, "text": "Fry's Electronics.  Every time I come here it's hit or miss. This last trip was definitely a miss. Let me explain.\\n\\nI needed ink for my HP printer. All I needed were all four colors, cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. Simple enough right? Well apparently the fools.......I meant the guys that work here don't know the difference. The first guy I spoke to pointed me to the Lexmark shelf of ink cartridges. Fail. Next guy I see tells me it was down another aisle and what do I see? Nothing but Canon inkjet cartridges.\\n\\nIt was not until I went towards the HP printers that I found the inkjet cartridges I needed. Thanks for wasting my time guys! I really appreciate it! Gotta love the employee customer service here.\\n\\nSpeaking of employee customer service, I have yet to see an employee here that looks like they really like working here. I for one would not want to work here. Morales seem really low here. Memo to Mr. Fry, if you want to improve employee attitude, I suggest you at least let these guys wear more casual clothing instead of the shirt and tie approach. It's obvious the men I see here are uncomfortable with what they are wearing. These guys can wear t-shirts and jeans for all I care. As long as they take care of the me, the customer.\\n\\nSo as I make my way to the front to pay for the items that I ended up finding myself, I couldn't help but notice the all the knockoff perfumes and colognes they were selling. You know, the kind that has knockoff names and the scent only lasts like 5 minutes. The kind of fake stuff that has people coming out of nowhere to try to sell to you as you are either going or coming from your car at a parking lot of whatever establishment you are patronizing. Why would an electronics store be selling this crap?\\n\\nAs for paying for my items, sometimes the guys that help you find something usually scan the items you plan on purchasing and it produces a document that you take with you to the cashier. This guarantees that sales associate that helped you get some kind of commission on the sale. Of course, I didn't get one from them that day but whenever I do, sometimes I get rid of the document if they give me any kind of attitude in helping me find what im looking for. My thing is, if you are just helping me enough just to get that commission and not genuinely care about me as an individual, then you don't deserve it.\\n\\nLastly, the one marketing ploy that I think was really smart of them is that when you make your way going towards the cashier they have tons of eye candy that you just cannot avoid not seeing. Things like thumb drives, batteries, snacks, drinks, and yes, lots of different candy. On more than one occasion, I end up giving in and get something I did not plan on getting at all. Yup, somebody knew what they were doing in regards to making you spend just a little more money. \\n\\nSo if you find yourself here needing something here, I suggest that you have plenty of time to spare and have some kind of gameplan. Oh, and don't even bother eating over at the caf\\u00e9. I ate there one time because I was so hungry that I couldn't wait to go somewhere after. I ended up getting a turkey bagel sandwich which was ok. I paid like 6 bucks and change for it. Kinda of pricey for a bagel. Don't think it was worth it.\\n\\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #51"}

EVERY SINGLE scheduled delivery was missed, multiple times, EVERY SINGLE delivery was incorrect and required MULTIPLE phones calls and was never corrected. Charged for deliveries I didnt ask for, charged for all of the mistake they couldn't get right. NONE of my phone calls seemed to register, or be noted or recorded anywhere..EVER. In my first month of service I called the company 15 times. Finally, after realizing they were utterly incompetent, not to be trusted, and after i called to cancel, i was charged auto debited for what was to be the last month, i called back and requested my debit card be removed from their system. I said i didn't trust them to get the billing right. Smart deal - i get a $39 dollar bill in the mail for erroneous deliveries i never asked for, and asked them to pick up. Every single charge due to their own mistakes. Not only are the people working for this company incompetent, they are dishonest liars.

The cornbread just fell apart, but that was the best part. $11 dinner, overpriced for serving.  The chef and cashier were lovely, I asked them for the best of what they had and this was it.

The sauce on the veg chilli relleno was ok but the filling was just mush.  Mine had a different sauce which was very odd but the kicker was the meat.  There is no way that was filet mignon, it was cubed chuck or similiar and tough.  My wife said the consistency reminded her of dog food and I hate to say it but I agree with her. We paid $26 for 1 small chilli relleno stuffed with tough meat and mushy vegetables. Service was ok until after we were done eating. Waiter asked if we were done and if we wanted dessert. I said no dessert and we are done. Took another 10 minutes to come back to table and asked if we wanted check. I said we are done just like before.

My husband and I went to see a Christmas concert here of The Piano Guys recently and that was the first time I've been here in a couple years. First off, I was shocked to see a line of people that extended down a full city block and then wrapped around and doubled back almost the whole way down the street. There were no dividers or ropes or any staff providing direction so everyone was confused as to where the line started and ended and I saw a ton of people \\\"taking cuts\\\". It seems like they could come up with a better system for getting people in the door. Fortunately it moved pretty quickly so we still made it to our seats before the show started.\\n\\nMy biggest complaints about this place are that there are not enough restroom facilities and also that the drink prices are outrageous. I know, I know, you could say the same about almost any other concert venue in the valley but that is no excuse. As others have mentioned the seats are a little on the small side but not too uncomfortable. I do wish there was more leg room, mainly because once people are seated there is absolutely no room left for walking if you have a seat near the middle of a row. I will say that the acoustics are great and the lighting and effects at the shows I have seen were wonderful. I also like that it is small enough that even the seats in the back can still see but I do wish that they had not put seats on the bottom sides where the edges of the stage block your view. They do warn you when you buy the tickets that it is an obstructed view but really you can not see hardly anything. They should have just used that space for more bathrooms instead of seats that are basically worthless."}

There are many beautiful pastries, biscuits, cakes, loaves of bread and open sandwiches on display. There are also daily 'pizzas' and soups, and you can get homemade ice cream in the 'food to go' section around the back, though I must emphasize that Peters yard main claim to fame resides in their fantastic baked goods. \\n\\nThe cardamon and cinnamon buns are somewhat famous in Edinburgh, as they are so good! They are also authentic. I have eaten the same buns in Norway and Sweden, and these were very similar...  or dare I say it, better? They are light, not too doughy, and enriched by a delicious spiced sugar. Even better (in my opinion) are the fruit buns: you get the same delicious pastry, but with custard cream and entire raspberries or blueberries. Wash that down with a cardamon hot chocolate or a cappuccino, and you have the breakfast of dreams.\\n\\nPeters yard caters for most diets, offering a few vegan cakes, soya milk, and a few gluten free options. The building is made with glass, and therefore unsurprisingly lets a lot of light into the room. This combats SAD which is almost inevitable during a Scottish winter. There are quite a few recipe books which are interesting to browse whilst waiting for your food. Every time I go there I get it into my head that I am going to start baking Nordic pastries!\\n\\nPeters yard is conveniently located on the edge of the quartermile development, between the University of Edinburgh and the meadows. This makes it ideal for student socials, picnics in the park and quick snacks.\\n\\nMy only problems with peter's yard:\\n\\n1. The price-I end up spending about \\u00a310 here for a light breakfast.\\n2.  The non-baked goods. They are not bad, per se, but this is not the expertise of Peters yard. I am a big fan of thin and crispy pizza, and find the pizzas here way too thick and starchy. The soup isn't bad either, but it's something which I make better at home for a fraction of the price. I have looked at the open sandwiches often in awe, then shied away after seeing the steep price tag.\\n\\nOther than that, this is a really great place for fresh bread, cakes, and above all PASTRIES!

the discount proving most fortuitous in the setting of a restaurant that has the gall to charge $14 for two tiny eggplant rolls and $12 for double espresso of less-than-ideal Lavazza served alongside, not over, ice as if defying one to make a mess in trying to do it themself.\\n\\nAcknowledging the fact that the first experience at Veranda was coordinated by PR with superlative service from start to finish, suffice it to say that a second meal booked under the name of two friends offered less impressive timing and having ordered substantially with requests for items to be sent out in a rather specific manner the start of the meal was almost inexplicably rushed - the delicious and soft focaccia hitting the table before menus were even opened and both fourteen dollar meatballs and the aforementioned eggplant arriving before a few small bites of brilliantly balanced salad were fully consumed.\\n\\nTreated next to a pizza that featured a surprisingly buttery crust with little char and rather flavorless tomatoes that thankfully received an upgrade from thickly applied Mozzarella and light accents of basil it would not be long before an onslaught of primi arrived and with the four-top table as well as meager sharing plates obviously overburdened despite our server personally suggesting he would \\\"space out the pastas\\\" two of the dishes were immediately sent back to the kitchen - Chef Minichiello obviously taking the gesture seriously by not only coming out to personally apologize, but also individually plating each subsequent course in tasting-menu fashion.\\n\\nSpeaking specifically to the quality of the noodles, aside from the signature \\\"jar\\\" with pasta that logically becomes a bit soft due to the cooking technique, it can only be said that most of Minichiello's housemade creations are served with textbook consistency and with the two meaty courses more 'up front' with the flavors of slow-cooked proteins allowed to shine the flavors of the Pasta Cotta Nel Vaso and Tagliolini were far more restrained, the first melding shellfish and herbs with light cream while the later was an aromatic masterpiece, the saffron and sea beans each offering their unmistakable flavors in balance to sweet, snappy prawns.\\n\\nPairing a half-chicken cooked Cacciatora-style, with far better results than that at Giada according to my two friends, to two sides that were simple yet impeccably prepared to maximize the flavor of every ingredient it was at this point that each in our party noted that we were becoming quite full and yet with a half-off dessert menu featuring no less than seven items I'd have liked to try it was with some restraint that only three were ordered - the doughnuts a but underwhelming when compared to the buttery seasonal Crostada, but neither even in the same ballpark as the 'signature' in terms of taste or presentation, the cotton-candy topped pedestal featuring soft lady fingers and mascarpone soaked in Amaretto with boozy blueberries and three balls of ice cream making for one heck of a 'sundae.'\\n\\nTipping on the pre-discount total to the tune of just over $200 for the table it must be said that considering the cost of the meal Veranda presented one of the best dining values on the Strip in this particular circumstance, but taking into account the service gaffs and truly laughable coffee upcharge the question becomes whether yet another visit could be justified at double the price - something I cannot say I'm certain about at this point."}

The roof is a nice place to sit on a comfortable fall day.  The service was also very good from the almost completely female staff.\\n\\nWe started out with she crab soup, a rarity inland.  It was more of a bisque with too much crabmeat and also a piece of a shell.  It was okay, but definitely not what I have gotten from any place at the beach - and I also have never had a shell in my she crab soup.\\n\\nThe menu is also a little limited, although they have \\\"chalkboard specials\\\" such as flounder.  The seafood platters are severely lacking, and the menu seems to offer more of a southwest twist on seafood than anything else.  Homemade guacamole is not a staple of the beach.  The blackened mahi mahi tacos were ok, but the fish lacked seasoning and there was not enough of the fish.  The Mexican coleslaw was probably the highlight.  The beans and rice were okay but the beans tasted like they were from a can.  The coconut shrimp (an appetizer) were okay, but slightly over-fried.\\n\\nI  would patronize this place again if they made their menu look a little more like this:\\n\\nhttp://www.hymanseafood.com/files/file/Hymans_Seafood_Menu.pdf\\n\\nI know Hyman's is not the best seafood in Chucktown, but I am using the menu as an example.

The steaks were really good - we chose the 85 day dry aged steaks - very tender, with a slight nutty flavor, cooked over charcoal to give it that extra flavour only fire can bring to meat. They came with the signature monte carlo potato (very tasty) and we ordered the grilled oyster mushrooms (these were unevenly cooked and had charred edges).

The first night I went to pull the sheets down, and I am not lying here, there was a used band aid in the BED!!! I called guest services and they sent a maid up immediately and changed all of the bedding and cleaned the room thoroughly. I should have upgraded or checked out right then. Because it only goes downhill from there...\\nThe bed was hard as a rock. There was mildew in the bathroom. The TV was tiny and was so dim, it was unwatchable. The wallpaper was tearing. The furniture was scratched up. The sink fixtures were rusting. The ventilation ducts were filthy! Where in the heck was the Re-model? The carpet and Flamingo picture on the wall? Seriously? This \\\"remodel\\\" looks worse than Motel 6's remodel down the street that I stayed at last year because there were no other rooms available in the city.\\nIf that wasn't bad enough, I find out that same evening that The Flamingo charged me $239 for the room. The problem is that I already prepaid for the entire vacation a month ago. I went to the front desk and asked why I was double charged and was told \\\"that just happens sometimes.\\\" Really? Well, that's a huge problem! That should never happen. Since I used a debit card, it took two days for that money to go back to my account. Sadly, for the Flamingo, I could have been gambling with that money in their casino, but I avoided their casino after that on purpose.\\nI also was pretty disappointed that I had to walk so far for the shuttle drop off from the airport due to their construction. Where are the bellboys? I toted luggage so far from the lobby that it was ridiculous!\\nThe first two days the weather was bad. It was cold and drizzling. So, I understand that the pool was closed. However, on the third day of my stay, it had warmed up nicely. The main adult pool was open and going strong with gambling poolside and alcohol sales in full swing. Unfortunately, the water slide area was not open. Why not? It was hot enough and there were tons of people.\\nI just lived with it all, since I was out of the room most of the time and I was to check out the next day. I did stop by the front desk and informed a Supervisor of all of these issues, and he apologized emphatically. He offered to credit me back two days worth of \\\"resort fees.\\\" This is a pittance. I very politely asked for the hotel manager's card and forwarded this to her as well. I am certain that the Caesar's company can do much better than two days of resort fees compensation.\\nAs of this review, the Hotel Manager has credited me back with the third day of resort fees and offered a free upgrade from a standard room to a \\\"Go\\\" room on my next visit. This is the difference between a regular (crappy) room to a fully renovated room. I do appreciate her efforts in what she has done, however, I think it is not above Caesar's Corporation to comp three days of a future visit IN FULL, in one of the fully renovated rooms or at another property of theirs."}

The decor is pretty cool - it's like luxe dark Egyptian glamour. Only the bottom floor was open so it wasn't very big. Just the bar area and dance floor with private tables, a small circular room with a few loveseats, tables and a cool chandelier in the back, as well as a long hallway to the bathroom behind that. There were free drinks for girls with the wristband until midnight so I took advantage of that. The DJ was spinning the generic hip-hop/top 40/house blend. It was pretty early so only a group of tipsy girls were on the dancefloor. Overall I thought it was a cute little place; a great intimate setting for a group of friends or a private party."}

Tacos were greasy and food was so so at best. My boss ordered a carne asada chimi that was full of greasy, old, and fatty pork.  Just not a good experience.  I think they worry about the bar business at night.  The older gentleman was very kind and courteous though."}

The nicest person in the joint was Johnny at the front door when he refunded my door charge because of the miserable experience there.\\n\\nMy friend was able to coordinate with management about getting us in the VIP short line and a discount for the guys (ladies were free). Still had to pay $20 to get in, and the prestige of the Bellagio did not carry inside this club.\\n\\nFirst it was too dark in there. How can you set up a club for a ton of hot ladies in there if I can't see them? Even security had to shine their flashlights on all the steps everytime you walked by. Even the lights on the dance floor made it hard to tell if the girl 5 feet away was actually a 9 or just caked in makeup.\\n\\nFound an empty spot at the bar, couldn't find a bottle list to see what scotch they had. Bartender walks over, I ask her what type of scotch they have since I can't see their bottles in the dark. She drops her jaw and rudely says, \\\"I have 50 types. What do you want?\\\" No offer of a menu, no suggestions, even my friend behind me said wow, what B*t$h. Alison, so it says on my receipt, did not get a tip for that overpriced 12-year drink. Maybe I caught this particular bartender on a bad night, but if I'm paying $20 or $30 just to be in there you had better offer some degree of service.\\n\\nThe busboys or servers or whatever those little guys in vests do literally sprint down hallways and push people out of their way. There is a bottle service delivery system that uses some weird blue diamond chariot thing carried by two guys and two girls with sparklers. There were no tables or extra dance areas, only two poorly lit go-go dancers. Overall, this club was not a positive experience.\\n\\nWhen we left after only 20 or 30 minutes, I asked to go back to the cashier but one of the eight suits coordinating door entry listened to my recap and refunded my money. That was the best part of my experience there.\\n\\nThe prestige of being in the Bellagio does not warrant a $30 entrance fee to the Bank."}

They need a larger space to accommodate the hoards of hungry diners waiting to eat here. For our family of three (two adults and a four year old) we got two orders of the \\\"meat and three\\\" which was a reasonable $32.32.\\n\\nThe proteins consisted of the beef brisket and half of a roasted chicken. The chicken -- unfortunately, a little dry -- was one huge bird. We had enough for leftovers the next day. The brisket was simply amazing. Calling it the best brisket in town might be justified. It didn't matter that there weren't any more knives at our table because it was as tender as a well cooked pot roast.\\n\\nOut of the six other items we got, the fried brussels sprouts were the runaway hit. They were crispy to the point of almost being like potato chips and so good that I'd be happy to eat them and nothing else on a return visit. The green beans were delicious and the two orders of mashed potatoes were good, especially if you like them smooth and creamy. The butternut squash had a consistency and the look of mashed sweet potatoes. The last item, an oreo pudding, was very good without being too sweet.\\n\\nThe best seat in the house might be the communal table. If you don't mind having dinner with complete strangers you could be entertained by the people around you.

I was in the area with a friend of mine who constantly talked about how breat this places side dishes were. \\n\\nWhen we pulled up I was surprised to see the exterior of the building. Not so appealing from the outside, neither was the area it is in. The inside was much better but nothing like some of the places in LA this restaurant is based off of. \\n\\nThe waitress that day seemed a gloomy and unwelcoming with her blank expressions and straight to the point service. I would have enjoyed the service a bit more if she was a bit more  enthusiastic. It wasn't till the end of our meal when we engaged conversation with her that she cracked a smile. \\n\\nWe ordered the tofu stew, since this is their specialty. I got the kimchee beef and my friend got the mushroom and beef. I like that they have the stone pots for the rice since no one else here in AZ does it. The rice came out a bit on the wet side but I was so hungry at this point it didn't matter. The sides that were presented to us was not very exciting. I don't know what all the hype was about the sides, it was just like any other place but a lot less. We only got 4 sides and one of them being roasted seaweed. Come on now, anyone can cut that up and serve it, I want something that I can't do at home. The stew was ok at best and did have a good amount of meat which is good. \\n\\nAll in all the service was ok, could have been better if my water was ever refilled. The food was ok nothing too exciting. A good place to go if you live in the area but like most of us who do not, not worth the drive. Possibly a harsh review since there are only a few Korean places in town but wouldn't you think since there are only a handful here and for some reason they all do tofu stew and a specialty that one would get it right. or at least enough for AZ but not this one to say the least."}

{"_id": 0, "text": "Having come from the East where Mellow Mushroom started, I'm pretty well-acquainted with the food from this place. Interesting thing is that Mellow Mushroom's franchising availability used to be hush-hush, so there weren't so many of them and those wishing to start one apparently had to jump through hoops just to inquire about it. Semi-interesting stories aside, since they've blown-up and made it so far as Phoenix the quality of the business has gone down. \\n\\nCase-in-point: The Tempe location.\\n\\nThis is the biggest Mellow Mushroom I've ever seen, and it's got a nice, inviting atmosphere. That is, until your waitress is at your table immediately upselling things before she even asks your drink order. My wife and I were so baffled what she said didn't even register until a few moments went by (something about having some very specific beers or something; not \\\"Would you like a beer to start things off?\\\" More like \\\"Would you like to start of with A Kirin Ichiban which is renowned in Japan for its malted deliciousness or how about a *more garbled over-the-top mess*?\\\") so we were just looking at her in awkward confusion. I get it's part of being a waitress and she's probably told to do it, but have some tact about it eh? \\n\\nNext bit of fun, the menu: Most of the Mellow offerings I'm used to, with a few Phoenix originals (one pie having chorizo, stuff like that), but wow: The prices are ridiculous. $10 for a *cheese* calzone? And it's not even organic or anything? $6 for a pint? ONE PINT? I haven't even hit 30 yet, and I feel like I'm talkin' about the good ol' days where a pint might cost $3 or maybe even $4, but nah; this pricing's just robbery.\\n\\nAnyway, I quit my mental griping about prices and ordered the pie. If you've never had Mellow before, the best way to describe it is \\\"bread-like with a touch of molasses, with that freshly-baked taste.\\\" Toppings are good, but really the crust does it for me and today was no exception. \\n\\nStill, the constant and ridiculous upsells from our waitress coupled with her pretty much rushing us (continually looking at our table from afar, at one point dropping the check on the table with a very non-subtle and possibly ironic \\\"Here's your check; no rush or anything!\\\") because we weren't ordering a ton of crap (do they get commission or something?) and ignoring our simple requests (asked for napkins twice, got none- but hey, we did get an offer to get some sort of cake put in the oven now so it could be ready when we were done eating. I love upsells!) makes me definitely not want to come to this place again. Given the new and improved pricing of Mellow Mushroom, I probably won't be going to any one of these places again.\\n\\nWhat a ripoff."}

I had ordered the chicken salad avocado and it was really salty.  I was trying to make sure I always had a bit of avocado with the chicken since it was very very salty.  I had also ordered the meat platter that provided a big variety.  It was a big portion, so that was very good.  I think that it could even be shared between four people and you'd still be full.  There wasn't very anything exciting to me about that meat platter.\\n\\nThe service was alright.  The hostess kind of started the night off badly for me in my opinion.  I noticed that nobody ever came to check on us.  I know the restaurant is small, but people can still stop by our table just to see how everything is.

She just ordered an Arnold Palmer but let's check the place out.  She said she had a horrible service and was never asked about a refill and after paying more for a while was finally handed a check. \\n\\nMy friend and I ordered drinks and split a fish and chips.  When it came time to pay the POS system was down.  We had to wait 20+ minutes with no offers of anything comped before being told that my order was $19 his was $8 and that they didn't know what tax was ut $31  should cover it..........  $4 tax on a $27 bill?  Seriously?  After waiting another 5min or so they finally calculated the tax for my bill, my friend gave them some money and told them to keep the change but was never given an accounting.  \\n\\nThis is some of the worst service I have experienced.  The waitresses were indifferent and the bartender lacked knowledge of the beers on tap to begin with, but having to wait 30min for the bill and then being given no consideration is unforgivable.  \\n\\nI sent the place an email outlining my complaints with service 24 hours ago and still haven't received a response.

It has to be, this is a break from the mundane life I leave behind, so why do I want to eat my standard weekly fare of life in the working world? I love sushi and because of it's nutritious nature figured this would be a great way to replenish all things lost to bottomless cocktails and greasy late night foods. I didn't partake in the consumption of any libations at lunch, but did hear that the mojito was pretty stellar.\\n\\nI ordered the trio seaweed salad that came beautifully presented on a three trayed dish of hijiki, wakame, and my favorite aka-tosaka. Each were lightly dressed with lemon and sidelined with some tomato caviar. Not terrible for a $11, but not overly substantial either. For lunch I ordered yellowtail jalapeno which was ok if not a little heavy on the jalapeno, and a spicy tuna that was all sorts of bland. I think I would have been happier enjoying these as a happy hour because it seems that the prices are a little easier to swallow for the quality of the food.

There seemed to be a decent amount of employees working but no one greeted us or acknowledged us.  A younger girl came over and without even making eye contact, just said in a very low voice, \\\"hi, how many\\\", we asked how long the wait would be and she said about 10 minutes.  Weird thing is, we noticed empty tables and booths all around but didn't want to be a pain and say anything, maybe they were short staffed even though they seem to have quite a bit on staff.... We sat down and we instantly started to notice how disgusting and dirty the place was.  The floors were disgusting and we were able to see the display case for their pies.  The case was nasty.  You could clearly tell the glass was not cleaned inside or outside for quite some time.  The inside of the case where the pies were, you could see food and other things on the bottom.  We both cracked some jokes about how gross the place was and both decided to not wait to eat.  We just got up and walked out.  Do not go here, you will be just as disappointed as us.

So I did a search on Yelp to help me decide where to go. That's how I found Mariscos Sinaloa. My boyfriend and I walked in. We were greeted by the staff. It was seat yourself so I chose a corner booth. A friendly waitress (wish I knew her name, she wore glasses and had a big smile all the time) immediately brought over chips & salsa and took our drink order. When she delivered our drinks I told her it was our first time there. She had a big smile on her face and welcomed us (again). Since a lot of the menu was in Spanish she helped us understand and explained some of the selections on the menu. She did it with enthusiasm which made us feel appreciated as guests. I love queso dip but did not see it on the menu. So I just took a stab at it and asked her if they had queso dip. She said they did but it was not on the menu. I was pleasantly surprised. The queso dip was very good and creamy. My boyfriend ordered the Camerones Baconera. He really enjoyed it. I sampled it and wouldn't mind ordering it for myself next time we come. Big plump shrimp swimming in a creamy, spicy, chipotle type sauce.  I ordered the Molcajetes. OMG!! Entr\\u00e9e big enough for 2. It had grilled octopus, carne asada, bacon wrapped shrimp, grilled green onions, cheese stuffed pepper, and grilled chicken in a spicy sauce sizzling in a hot clay-type pot. I was not disappointed!!

However, to my slight relief, when I came here with some friends, I found the atmosphere considerably more restrained - in fact, we were the only people in the restaurant, probably because we were there early on a week night.\\n\\nFortunately the isolation didn't stop us from enjoying the perfectly cooked food.  The menu contains no surprises, featuring typical Greek dishes such as Moussaka and Pork Souvlaki, but our meal proved there's nothing wrong with keeping things traditional, as everything was excellent, especially the starters.  What particularly stood out for me was the spanakopita (feta and spiach pacrels), which had this amazing crispiness that is never there when I cook them myself.  The service was also really good, as you'd expect, given there was nobody else there!\\n\\nFrom Fiona H.'s review, I get the impression My Big Fat Greek Kitchen gets considerably more lively at weekends.

That makes it better than Mirage which doesn't quite have enough space for the chill out and Canyon Ranch which is more oriented toward being a Gym.

We were originally planning to go to Piper's Pub in the South Side, but his car was unavailable, so he asked if we could go somewhere in Squirrel Hill or Oakland, and this is what we chose.\\n\\nWe each ordered one cone ($4.99 each)--I ordered the white pizza one, and he ordered the Mediterranean.  Staff was quite friendly and conversational, though kind of wishy-washy when my friend asked for a flavor recommendation.  Our cones took between 10-15 min. to cook, but we were the only people ordering at that time (6:30 on a Mon.).  When they came up, we were hoping to sit at one of the two tables outside, but each of the tables had a person sitting and loitering at it.  I found this slightly annoying since it was clear that neither of these people had bought anything, and tables (incl. outside ones) should be reserved for paying customers.  So we ended up sitting inside across from a table of noisy high school students.\\n\\nMy white pizza cone was filled with the toppings you'd expect on a white pizza: mozzarella, ricotta, and broccoli.  Though I'm a white pizza aficionado, I was underwhelmed by the flavor of my cone, which I found bland and insufficiently savory.  I think this was due to the ratio of cheese being off (too much ricotta).  Having said that, my cone was quite filling (I didn't regret not ordering a second), and was served at just the right temperature (hot but edible).  My friend enjoyed his Mediterranean cone, which he said contained quite a few olives, though it was served hotter than mine, so it was difficult for him to eat (even after he'd reached the middle after several minutes, it was still steaming).\\n\\nIf you're in the mood for a slice of pizza or an inexpensive meal, I'd recommend checking this place out.  Based on my review and others, there are some kinks the ownership needs to work out, but they have an interesting product.  I'd return, but I think I'd try another flavor next time, such as the pepperoni or Hawaiian.  3.5 stars."}

{"_id": 3, "text": "I think I might have spent a little too long deciding what to include in this post, but as someone who has spent a long time renting and had some pretty miserable experiences, I try to include everything I wish I would have known. Apartment reviews can be TERRIFYING, there are some angry renters out there. Here's what I took from my lovely 10 month stay at Miramonte. \\n1. This apartment doesn't look like much from the outside, and its nothing fancy for sure, but in my experience the office staff is extremely helpful, the maintenance man is reliable and friendly (eventually I even had no problem giving him permission to enter while I wasn't there) and its very reasonably priced. The interiors are updated with nicer carpet, newer kitchens and they have washer and dryers! big plus for me.\\n\\n2. The pool is awesome, when it works. They have been having some issues but I do believe its fixed now. The gym is tiny but usually empty. \\n\\n3. its pretty quiet, most of the time. I lived upstairs and was never bothered by my neighbors noise. But I do believe my downstairs neighbor was slightly annoyed by me (and I am not loud and hardly home.) So Point A--live upstairs. I've found that to be true in EVERY apt complex ive ever lived in. Point B--PLEASE NOTE--THIS IS IMPORTANT--there is an elementary school on the east side of the apartment complex. I lived directly up from the parking lot, facing the school playground, and you could absolutely hear little kids playing in the morning.  It didn't ever bother me because I work all week, I only discovered this when I happened to be home sick one Wednesday. If you work a Monday-Fri 9-5 you really wont notice so I would not let that deter you from moving in. However if you sleep in late during the week, choose your location carefully, don't get a unit that faces the school.\\n\\n 4. The office staff will really try to be accommodating. A new office manager took over a couple months after I moved in and you can really tell she wants people to be happy about the complex. I lived here while in the process of buying a house and definitely did my share of calling the office staff with questions about extending my lease, ending my lease, month to month options, etc. When my house closed 2 months before my lease ended, of course I couldn't get out of my legally binding contract (no surprise to me there) but I was surprised that they were very helpful about my options to sublease it myself or find someone to take over my lease completely. They definitely did as much as they could. \\n\\n5. Parking for visitors isnt the worst I've seen but it can be difficult. There are always tons of spots open on the south end of the complex, but in the evenings most of the other public ones are taken. \\n\\n6. Bugs- always a big concern of mine and I would have no shame in admitting if I found them. (see my other apt review, ha!). Honestly, I found one big cockroach about a month after I moved in, called the office, they had the sprayer come and I never saw another one again. (I lived there for 10 months)\\n\\n7. charges. They WILL charge you for damages done to your walls or carpets, for anything that is not top-notch clean, or anything that isnt as it was when you moved in. But they aren't trying to scam you. Use your common sense on this one, you get a form to fill out when you move in that lists every detail of every room, FILL IT OUT. Keep a copy. Be present when they do the final walk through and you will be aware of any discrepancies. Just be a responsible renter and you will only pay the standard $35 carpet cleaning fee. \\n\\nHope that was helpful to anyone considering an apartment here. Granted all experiences and units are different, so if you move in and hate it, whoops. If you move in and like it, as I did, you're welcome."}

{"_id": 4, "text": "school is almost over and last night when i went to our open house at school i realized how bless my kids are to be able to go there and what great teachers my kids have! This school is academically amazing (alex is 2 grades ahead, sara started the year struggling and now is getting a's and b's partly bc her teacher has given countless hours of her own time (free of charge) after school to work with her, & trey actually likes school!) This school doesn't just use the title \\\"christian school\\\" this school is just as serious about academics as growing the kids in their relationship with the Lord. I truly think this is a treasure and i would love to share the experience with all my friends. If you are thinking about a change for next year, go visit before schools out, you have to see the kids there with the teachers to experience God's presence in this school!! With 3 kids in this school all with different academic abilities and personalities this school has been a great fit for all of them. Academically kids are pushed. If your child needs extra help a tutor will meet with them, also teachers have homework help times after school to work with kids. If your chid is gifted they will be placed in honors classes and be expected to perform!  I have kids at both extremes and know this first hand. My only downfall with this school is that after school programs are limited in the early grades. However, the school is always open to suggestions and if parents have a desire to start something I know from experience the school makes the time and the space. I feel like at this school a lot of the kids go to club sports, private lessons, etc so the school has tried but many of these kids are already spread thin after school.  We have been there for several years and I know from reviewing the national testing that my kids do every year that all 3 kids are at or way above grade level (even my child that struggles.)

Even if I put these items aside, I still experienced issues with my stay.\\n\\nFirst, even though the facility appeared to have undergone a bit of a face lift...well it just didn't lift quite high enough for me. The rooms...even if you decided to put in a flat screen television (which they did) does not mean that it makes the room better. The carpet is worn over and the air did not work very well. Frankly it was a sauna, no matter how many times we tried to turn it down. The beds were okay. I just couldn't get past how worn the room seemed. In addition, very small. There was not a lot of wiggle room with two full size beds...oh that's right, the size of the bed. I am five foot five inches. When I spanned my arms across the bed my hands dangled over. Weird. I am happy I did not have to share.\\n\\nOn the plus side they do have a 24 hour Starbucks on site AND they have a coffee maker IN THE ROOM! This locate is geared towards business travelers. There is a 24 hour gym (which is quite nice actually, considering that I had just come from a place where their gym closed down at 7 pm....I know it is Vegas and I should be out drinking and causing general chaos at 7 pm not trying to work out). The WiFi was spotty, so much so that I wound up turning on my own hot-spot rather than deal with it.\\n\\nAs stated before this is not for the Vegas experience. It is located a few blocks from the strip and as someone mentioned before I don't believe that I would walk by myself at night from the strip back to the hotel. In fact, I didn't and I was with someone. We grabbed a cab rather then debate whether or not we may be uncomfortable.\\n\\nSo in a nutshell if I were a business traveler and wanted nothing else other than business amenities, then I would probably check this place out, maybe.\\n\\nOh...and stop saying you have a casino on location...just because you splattered a few machines on your lobby floor (okay maybe more than just a few) does not (in my head of course) qualify as a casino.

Hummm, surely this must not be our order.  \\nShe turned around, we told her we were waiting for 2 diet cokes, and even asked, Are those diet cokes? and she starts to hand them to us.

How they are in business is a mystery to me, as I've never had a more miserable experience with any company in any industry.  L&S is bad-Bad-BAD.  \\n\\nHere is our story -\\n\\nLast weekend, we had a problem with our A/C unit raining water into the hallway under our vent.  We called our landlord's Home Warranty Company, and were told that with emergency service, someone would arrive later that day.  \\n\\nFour hours later, Andy from L&S arrived.  He told us that he would have to order a new condenser pan.  He was very friendly and very apologetic, but said that as it was the weekend, he'd have to order it Monday morning.  He also assured us that it would be ready to install by Monday afternoon.  Andy was the only positive part about our experience so far...In my opinion, he should go work for a company worthy of his service.\\n\\nSo, Monday afternoon, I took off work early and came home in order to be there for the service call.  At 5:00 I still had not heard from them, so I called.  They said that the pan had not been completed, and that we would have to wait until Wednesday.  \\n\\nWednesday morning, I called L&S, and they guaranteed me that it would be installed that afternoon.  I again took off work early in order to be available for their service technician.  At 5:00, still no call, no show.  I called L&S again, and they said that the pan was still not ready.  They said that they would schedule me an appointment for Saturday between 8 and noon, as that was the earliest they could guarantee an installation.\\n\\nWe cancelled our plans for Saturday morning and stayed home to yet again be available for their technician.  That morning, we get an email from our landlord telling us that he'd been informed by the home warranty company that L&S is reporting that our A/C has not been repaired because we have not made ourselves available to their technicians.  My head exploded.  \\n\\nAt 10am, we still had not received a confirmation phone call from L&S.  Because of the letter from our landlord and our past experience with this company, we thought it would be a good idea to check in and make certain that the tech was on his way.  We were told that the technician had already picked up the pan, that we were on his schedule, and to expect him soon.  \\n\\nAt 2:30pm, he still had not arrived.  We called the office, and we were informed that he was \\\"just now\\\" at the shop picking up the pan.  We informed the gentleman on the phone that we'd been told the tech had picked up the pan earlier that morning.  His very snooty reply was, \\\"well I guess he was picking up a pan for another customer, because he's going to get yours now.\\\"  He then put us on hold to call the metal shop and verify that his tech was getting the correct pan.  \\n\\nWhen he returned to the line 15 minutes later, we were informed that the pan was the wrong size, and they had to rush order a new one.   The phone rep was extremely rude, and said they 'might' get the pan back by end of the day and that I could call back in an hour.  \\n\\nWe called back in an hour.  We were told that they had the pan, but they still had to apply the sealant and then check to make sure it was holding water.  He was very rude and said that they would apply the sealant that evening and that someone would be in the shop by 9:00AM on Sunday.  He said they would call me with an update once they arrived.  \\n\\nSunday at 9:30 I called the shop.  Again, the man was very snide and said someone was on the way to the shop now, and that they'll call me once they arrive to test it.  An hour later, I call again.  They are just pouring water in the pan, and they'll call me 90 minutes to inform me that it's done and schedule a time for this afternoon to have it installed.  \\n\\nAt 12:15, I try to call the shop.  No one answers.  About 3 minutes later I get a text saying that they are on their way to the shop to check the pan, and to wait by the phone as they will be calling me soon.  An hour goes by, and I text the number back inquiring about the pan.  No response.  Another 2  hours pass.  I call, and the shop is closed.  No answer, no response.  It's now 4:00.  Still no call from L&S, still no text, still no install tech at my house.  \\n\\nThey are telling my landlord that this is my fault because I'm not being cooperative or making myself available to their techs.  They do not call customers to keep them updated on progress.  They do not show up when promised.  They lie to customers about what has been done.  They do not complete the work in a timely manner.  They are rude.  I am furious.  It's been 8 days for what was supposed to be an emergency call.  \\n\\nMy AC is still raining water into my hallway, and I have no way of knowing when these people will actually arrive to install this pan, nor how many more days I'll have to miss work in order to be here for their no-call-no-show \\\"appointments.\\\""}

I didn't know about the coupon, so I paid for myself and my guest.  My brother came in just after the guy ran the transaction and mentioned the coupon.  At this point, the employee became very difficult.  He told us that he couldn't honor the coupon since I didn't mention it, and it was too late.  He berated us for even suggesting that we ask for a discount after the fact.  My brother told him about telling the person on the phone about it, and how it shouldn't be hard to reverse the transaction especially since the deal was advertised for this day only.  The employee continued to be rude so I just suggested we go play and see if someone else was working when we finished.  As a side note, when we finished, there was someone else and they did give us a $40 refund (value of the coupon) but had to find the owner to do it, which took about 15 minutes.\\n\\nPace of play was very slow, just over 5 hours (which to me, is painful, I'm used to 4 hour rounds at home and we walk...this was 5+ hours with everyone in carts).

Easy to navigate and plenty of surv cameras so that you don't feel like you will get jacked before you ever get into the building (Btw. I can never understand why most casino property patron robberies are late hours after 94% of people are leaving with less $ than they came with but i suppose they get stalked after leaving the cage and cashing their cheques/chips/one arm bandit vouchers)   Lots of security guards in between the elevators and casino floor.  Getting carded nearing age 40 always makes me feel a bit flattered yet annoys me frothing to get to the action.  \\n\\nSLOT MACHINES:  one of my least favorite gaming activities but THE RIVERS machines have plush chairs for my lazy ass with cool little TVs built into machines for ADHD people to multi task as to distract their clearLY addictive slot play.... slid a CIVIL WAR GENERAL/CLOWN PRESIDENT dollar bill into  \\\"blazin 7s\\\" and after about 24 full credit spins, my balance read goose eggs..(and people think humans continue to evolve HA)  -$50\\n\\nTABLE GAMES:  I went with the lesser of all evils BJ/21.  It was early afternoon and the limits seemed a bit high so I choose a  $ 25 dollar table and bought in for 2 bills.. .. Original Dealer was quick and courteous and didn't seem to vibe off of people  getting buried or complaining about poor tipping.  Typical BJ session  and get bored with it up 7 units and getting a baby powder stench from the septuagenerarian seated to my left..... +175\\n\\nPOKER ROOM:  very spacious, modern and smokefree(reminded me of the Venetian Las Vegas when it was first to open such a layout back in \\n~2002),,,,,, played 1/2 NL hold em for over 2 hours and was very pleased with the polite yet gregarious dealers who knew how to get the hands out fast yet not cluster f/ ck the process and confuse the players by needing to redeal or take 24858 minutes to seperate side pots..... I played tight and unfortunately so did everyone else so I lasted 45 minutes and -$65\\n\\nBEVERAGES:  self service coffee/tea and soft drink stations which oddly seemed like they had more people in line for them then were in the rest of the casino.... oh and some goofball filling his oversized thermus with MOUNTAIN DEW  (official drink of white trash)HAHAHA   i loved that!!!!!!    Many bars on the grounds and being that it must be state laIw or something not to offer free alcohol to players, I proceeded to sit at a bar and drink a beer and as usual in casinos, the only person not playing a slot machine.  Was something near 5 bucks for a domestic so i threw down $8 ...-$8\\n\\nBATHROOMS: large and clean in typical casino fashion and satisfying in a way that I didn't feel like I needed to blow torch my hands instead of washing them after taking a basic leak  $0 (and don't laugh as i remember paying toilet stalls when i was a wee lad in Nia Falls )\\n\\n\\nI didn't try any of the restaurants as ran out of time and patience to do so.   Overall THE RIVERS was a decent  yet a bit plain jane facility and just the vibe of any casino knowing it preying on my and everyone else's money can never make it 5 stars but  I probably will return and the next time not alone and partially intoxicated.  In an odd way it reminded me of MGM Grand Las Vegas in its color schemes and layout with a mundane atmosphere.....  THE RIVERS 3.5 Stars :)"}

The restaurant feels like a more contemporary version of a traditional American restaurant.  The restaurant's straightforward and kind of old-school decor (as well as the loud atmosphere) reminds me of a Daily Grill.\\n\\nThe restaurant (at least for lunch) features mainly classic dishes like buffalo wings, Reuben sandwich, pastrami sandwich, spaghetti and meatballs, tuna salad sandwich, and so on.  The menu and the prices felt similar to a lot of the 24 hour Vegas cafes though I found my experience at Red, White & Blue a little better.\\n\\nI had the seared ahi tuna, which was served with wasabi mashed potatoes and a citrus sauce, but I opted for the green beans instead of the potatoes.  The ahi tuna was decent.  It was served rare and was pretty fresh.  The citrus sauce was flavorful and light.\\n\\nThe green beans were cooked properly.  Nice crispness to them and also fresh.  There were also some pickled onions and asparagus on the plate and both were fine and added flavor.\\n\\nMy friend's lobster cobb salad was huge and it did not look that great.  I don't think she was that impressed with it.\\n\\nBoth dishes came with pretty generous portions.\\n\\nService was good.  The waitress was friendly and attentive.\\n\\nLike other Vegas restaurants, this place was overpriced.  Sandwiches were in the $13-$17 range while entrees were in the mid-$20s.  I've definitely had better food at the same prices, but I've also definitely had worse food in Vegas at those prices.\\n\\nThere are plenty of mid-range priced restaurants available at Mandalay Bay (like Burger Bar, which is okay, and Border Grill--I haven't been there).  Because of that, you may be able to find a better meal at the same price around here.  Still, Red, White & Blue was better than I expected and I wouldn't swear off coming here again under the right circumstances.\\n\\nParking is complimentary (both valet and parking structure)."}
{"_id": 1, "text": "On my 30th birthday I came here with a huge group of friends.  The food was great, the beer was great, and the service was awesome. Fast forward 6 years, it's my triumphant return to Montreal.  I decide to revisit a place that was a shining memory.  \\n     I walked in, and the place looked different, smaller somehow. There was no great huge room wallpapered with TV's playing sports.  The place was practically empty.  I grabbed a seat, and sat down in the chair.  A waitress came over and asked if I'd like a beer. I looked at the time, it was 11:30, but then remembered I was on vacation, and said a cold beer would be swell. Waitress ran off to get my beer and I began to peruse the placemat/menu.  I saw fish and chips, and felt fish and chips and beer would make for a splendid breakfast. (Don't judge me, being on vacation means you can do stuff like that.) \\n     My beer arrived and I placed my order. Some time later, my food arrived. It looked delicious. I cut into the battered piece of fish and it was quite greasy. The fries were kinda greasy too. The food was just barely within 'ok' parameters. It was heavy and very very greasy. The beer, an ice cold bud light, was magnificent.  \\n     The waitress was friendly enough, but shortly after I arrived, the place got very very crowded and she was swamped.  She had help, but I don't think it was enough.\\n\\n     So it turns out the place moved about five or six years ago. Apparently just after I had been there last. This place, not quite as good as their former incarnation.\\n\\n         To recap: Super greasy 'meh' food, good cold beer, service is decent. I prefer the memory of this place to the actuality of this place."}

First off, I am glad that Cineplex offered free movie tickets in exchange of my no longer valid AMC points card and very happy that this movie theater now offers more affordable rates compared to AMC.

It's very roomy and comfy. Even their washrooms are better than other places because they offer paper toilet seat covers, just like in the airplane!\\n\\nOne thing I noticed over the past year is that they seem to be cracking down on people sneaking in to watch perhaps 2 movies in a row or going into another room. There's very little surveillance in this theater, the only person checking your ticket is right at the entrance and once you're in, you have free range. \\nThis is no longer possible because they do not feature the name of the movie on the top of the room.

Even so, it was quite edible, and much better than tacos at other places.\\n\\nI LOVED the vegetable taco. The texture was perfection--crisp, with lots of flavor.\\n\\nFor my free side, I got a house side salad with a chipotle vinaigrette (I think). I was pleased with how large the salad was, and the dressing was unique and good.\\n\\nThis is my new favorite taco place in Phoenix. The food and ambience can't be beat. Sadly, my friends have now scattered across the country, but now I can drag my family here whenever we're in the vicinity of downtown. I must share the sanctity of this place."}

This was our second stop and the intent was to try a new place, score some hh-priced drinks and maybe grab a bite if anyone was hungry. Mission accomplished!  I really dug the place. I like the modern and open feel to the restaurant and bar. It was just before 11 and there were no tables open for my large group, but that was fine since we were mostly drinking anyways. The bartender was cool and made us drinks as fast as we could order em. The Pomegranate Martini was da bomb! So good i had 2! Some friends ordered food and they said it was good, but i only tasted the potatoes (yummy). I was too busy being the birthday girl to eat. =)  Chatted up some ladies at the bar who ended up being off-duty servers at Iruna. They encouraged me to come back for dinner, which i expressed a desire to do, and even bought me a shot!  Once i get back here for dinner, i look forward to updating with more food details and awarding another star!"}

Now, ordinarily (especially in Las Vegas) most establishments won't honor their Happy Hour specials outside of the bar area, so when we got to our table I asked the hostess if we could still get Happy Hour specials in the dining room.  She was rude and seemed a annoyed that I was asking her that question.  She said she thought we could and I reiterated that most places don't allow that.  She then sarcastically replied that I would have to speak with our server.\\n\\nOk, so our hostess wasn't actually interested in being cordial, whatever.  Our server arrived and informed us that we COULD get Happy Hour prices and we ordered drinks and several appetizers.  One thing I liked about this place was that if you order a Red Bull/Vodka (which wasn't included in the Happy Hour cost), they give you the remainder of the Red Bull in the can and our server instructed me to just order a Happy Hour vodka and mix it myself.  I like when an establishment thinks of me and my wallet before their final bill total.\\n\\nAll in all, the food was good and the drinks were good, but the service had room for improvement.  However, I will say that we ordered one of our items, the pototo chip nachos, and it didn't have enough cheese on it.  The manager made his rounds to inquire about everyone's evening and when he stopped at out table, one of the girls pointed it out to him.  He immediately took the entire dish back to the kitchen and had them add more cheese to it.  That just sat well with me.\\n\\nI'll more than likely be back, but I'll plan for it to be on a more leisurely weekday and hope that the OVERALL customer service is better."}

Subjected to a long line while the chefs and his buddies took time out to booze it up, spend minutes at a time talking to who knows whom, and the chef himself light heartedly but LOUDLY chastising one of his cooks for apologizing for the wait with this gem - \\\"Hey man, don't ever apologize for how long it takes to produce art.\\\"  Art being dry, terrible bao bun, an overcooked pork belly, and over sauced short rib in the taco.  I mean, they DRENCHED that taco in sauce.  And the sauce was gross.  I guess the tortilla for the taco was fine though.  :)  I had to give a special shout out to those jackasses.  Because their food is nowhere near good enough to have that kind of ego.  \\n4) Many of the vendors closed TWO HOURS before the event ended.  What?!  \\n\\nI like the idea.  And I would give it another chance.  But triple the number of vendors or don't put it on groupon and keep the number of people down.  It was absolutely ridiculous.\\n\\nI will give a positive, not sarcastic, shoutout to Shirley Chung of China Poblano.  That sandwich and those ribs were delicious!"}

I wanted something simple, but not too simple; something modern, but with a retro twist; something cool, but without looking like it's trying to be cool... Not too much to ask, is it? Not at Z Gallerie, where I found exactly what I was looking for - at what I consider very reasonable prices ($600 for the bed, $300 per nightstand). In addition to the furniture in the store, which in addition to furniture included lamps & artwork, we were shown their catalog, which contained an even larger selection. After not finding anything I liked anywhere else, I found myself now having to choose between several different bedroom sets.\\n\\nService at the time of purchase was pleasant and helpful. Once I made my selection, I waited patiently while the cashier called the warehouse to find out if the items were in stock or needed to be special ordered (longer delivery time). I was informed that my items were in stock and would be delivered within 2 weeks. Sadly, this did not happen. In fact, nothing happened. I never heard from them again. When I called them I was informed that my items had to be special ordered, and would not arrive for 3-4 weeks. I was assured I would receive a phone call from the delivery company within that timeframe. 4 weeks later, I called back to find out what was going on. I was told a manager would call me back. I left three additional messages over the next three weeks (each time providing my phone number), before finally speaking with a manager, who informed me that my furniture had arrived the week before. The problem? She said they had wrong phone number on file. If I hadn't provided my phone number 4 times, this could have been a valid excuse. But I did.

I initially wanted to order the ahi salad but I came to pick up the food around 3pm and I just didn't think the salad would be as crisp since it was sitting all day as if they made it fresh to order.

{"_id": 3, "text": "Coming to Sardine for happy hour and their deliciously inexpensive bar menu has become a sporadic date night favorite of my boyfriend and I.  We have been in for a nice sit-down dinner before, but are somehow not has happily satisfied by our experience as we are sitting at the stainless steel bar being served by their talented bartenders.  \\n\\nFirst, the happy hour is from 4-6pm Tuesday through Friday.  $3 Stellas and house wine cannot be beat.  The oysters are also half price. For only about $1-2 per shot, it's a great deal.   If you miss happy hour, they still offer their house wine for a meager $20 a bottle (red or white) and it's decent for the price. \\n\\nThere are several dishes we tend to order on a regular basis.  Though the full menu is available at the bar, we always stick to the bar menu.   First, I must mention the mussels. The appetizer portion of this dish is enough, with the frites, to feed two mildly hungry adults.  They are served in a very hot cream sauce, infused with steamed fennel, tomato, and sprigs of thyme.  The frites are equally delicious.   I am a bit ashamed to admit this, but when the mussels have been eaten, and only the creamy broth remains, I dump the rest of the frites into the bowl and indulge in a little french fry soup.  Embrace the unhealthiness, it is totally worth it.\\n\\nThe Sardine burger is not to be missed (only offered on the bar menu).  Although a bit unusual, the toppings of onion jam, figs, and gorgonzola compliment the fatty beef patty perfectly.   As with all of their sandwiches, it comes with a large side salad and frites.  Again, just this plate of food and perhaps a small appetizer are more than enough to feed my boyfriend and I.  \\n\\nBottom line- stick to eating at the bar and ordering wisely.  The portions are huge on the bar menu, and the price is right for this otherwise fairly expensive Madison favorite."}

Now on to the Catfish Delight - for $12.95, you would expect at least enough pieces to make up 1/2 a fillet.  There were only 5 or 6 very small pieces in the order.  The catfish WAS NOT crispy at all even though the menu says its \\\"deep fried\\\".  The catfish was rubbery and tasted more like it was battered and cooked in the microwave than a deep fryer.  The sauce was served on the side and AGAIN, they screwed that up.  I asked for \\\"spicy\\\" (10) and it had zero kick to it.  WTF?!?!

My husband and I ordered Poutine as a starter and found it \\\"okay\\\". You could definitely tell the fries were of the generic food service variety, and the gravy tasted as if it came straight from the jar. My husband ordered the pork shank and mash and was definitely let down. There was far more inedible fat and connective sinews than actual meat. I ordered the \\\"peppy\\\" pizza which was okay but wound up picking most of the pepperoni off because it was filled with hard gristle! I really wanted to give them a decent review, and I'm sure that other locations in MTL are decent, however, this one just didn't hit the mark- at all."}

(the bar section wasn't busy either) but he was friendly, so i can't complain too much. i'd definitely go back. oh, another bonus: they serve pizza super late!"}

And Les 3 Brasseurs was one of the those lucky few. While there is not way to avoid chain restaurants all the time. I try to support local places. So bare with me as I explain to you why I love this place. \\n\\nI was in Montreal for the weekend, visiting friends from Uni. I was also there with a friend from Cincinnati, taking him on his first Canadian adventure. On our first night, we were on our own and up to our devices for getting dinner. We chose Les 3 Brasseurs mostly because they brewed their own beer. I mean as a beer lover, that is just heaven for me. We got placed at the bar because it was a crowded Friday night. The bartender was very attentive and very beautiful. She was more then happy to speak English. And she pretty much gave us a college level course on their beer selection. We went with two liters of the Amber. I mean we were planning on drinking, might as well go \\\"balls to the wall\\\". Along with our beer, we ordered their Poutine. And while I try not to explain food as orgasmic. A plate of their poutine maxi is just that, orgasmic. My friend had the open faced seafood sandwich. And I ordered the Quebec Flammekuchen. Covered in a local cheese,bacon and onion. It was so good. We became friends with a few of our fellow bar sitters. And with the assistant to the bartender, he wasn't a busboy and he was allowed to take orders, just not pour them. Weird? Anyway. We kept ordering beer and shots of Sortilege ( a wonderful maple bourbon that is just amazing). Before we knew it, it was 2am. And we were very well gone. So with a few of our new friends we met at Les 3, we moved to a cheaper drinking hole. And the rest of the night is kinda blurry after that. But I will always eat here when I am in Montreal. Hell, until I find a better place. This will be my favorite place to eat in Montreal! Bring on the flame war."}

We came back at 4:30 to find a gentleman outside on the phone and 1 other couple in the bar, but no bartender. About 5 min later the man from outside comes in and steps behind the bar. We gave him a living social deal (2 burgers and 2 beers) but he didn't know what to do with it and left the bar again. About 10 min later we were able to order but had no silverware for our meals. Beer from the tap was not very chilled and we often sat for 10-20 min with an empty drink and no help from the bartender who was too busy chatting with his friends or on his phone to pay attention to paying customers. Also saw the bartender give out free shots to friends of supposed \\\"$50 a shot\\\" whiskey with no charge. Other staff were sitting around eating and doing nothing and one staff member was busy stocking the bar where we were eating (isn't this something you do before opening your doors?). Burger was average and bun was cold as if just removed from freezer. Will not return for eating or \\\"happy hour\\\" which was nonexistent. However later at night the bar filled with country dancers which was fun to watch. If I were ever to go back would wait til later at night as it was a more fun, country bar atmosphere.

{"_id": 2, "text": "Good work, good price. Great owner. Issues with punctuality and communication. This was a really tough review to write and I wish I could give different star values for different aspects of the business. I'm going to do my best just to stick to the facts here.\\n\\nNow for the details:\\nWe needed an estimate to replace all of the AC duct work in our crawl space. Had one estimate from another company and called Mark's after reading all of the positive Yelp reviews. Here's how it went down:\\n\\nWednesday: Called around 3pm asking to set up an appointment for an estimate. Easton says he can come sometime before 5 that day to look things over. Receive another call at 5:30 saying it is very hot outside and he would rather come tomorrow morning instead. Make an appointment for 9 on Thursday. \\n\\nThursday: Hubby called me at 10 asking if I had heard from them since no one had come or called. Called and Easton said they were running late but would be there by 11. He showed up at 12:30 without any additional notification (phone call, etc). Once he was actually on site, hubby liked Easton and the price was good enough that we decided to have the work done. Easton said he would call to schedule it. After a day of not hearing from them we called him and scheduled it for Monday. He said they would be there by 9 to start the job.\\n\\nMonday: Around 10:30, hubby called me to ask if I had heard from Easton, since they had not arrived. Remember, they were supposed to start a multi-hour job at 8am, and this is July in Phoenix- I doubt they were looking forward to being up in our crawl space come mid-afternoon. Called Easton and he said that they had had several emergency calls that morning and couldn't start as early as they wanted to so they pushed us to tomorrow instead. Without calling to let us know! When I asked why we had not been notified Easton replied that they did not have the invoice with our phone number! \\nNow I understand that in Phoenix in the summer, a non-working air conditioner is an emergency situation and schedules change (I work by appointment, I get that). However, I don't understand why we weren't notified of the schedule change. When I asked this, Easton replied, \\\"do you want us to do the job, or not? If you don't we can just not do it.\\\"\\n\\nAt this point, we had only dealt with Easton. I asked him for Mark's phone number thinking that I might have better luck with him. Fortunately, I did. Mark was extremely understanding and apologetic. He asked when we wanted the job started on Tuesday (8am) then offered to come out with Easton and make sure everything was to our satisfaction.\\n\\nTuesday: Phone call at 8:15 from Easton saying that they were running late and would be there shortly. I think they arrived around 9. Hubby says the work went according to plan, Mark showed up and was very apologetic, and it was all finished by about 1pm.\\nWhen I got home later that day I was looking over the invoice and realized that they had only cleaned the inside coils, not the outer ones on the unit up on the roof. I called Mark to ask about it and he sent Easton out later that day to clean the outside coils as well.\\n\\nIn the end, this is a good company that could be great with some improved communication and scheduling. Hubby says that before Easton left our place on Tuesday he heard him on the phone with another client who had called because he was late. He told her he would be there in another hour but that he had another visit or two ahead of her. It seems like he is trying to fit too many visits into too short of a time frame instead of scheduling more realistically."}

The wine list was not extensive but there was plenty to choose from to complement the meal. Wrapped it all up with a 375ml bottle of tawny port from Warres and a selection of fine Quebec cheeses. Couldn't ask for more. The decor is minimalist with the menu prominently displayed on a large blackboard which stimulated discussion around the table. There was also the option of a 7 course degustation menu which looked very interesting. There is a patio but, not surprising for a central restaurant, it is close to the road. The service was excellent. Very friendly, attentive and timely without being annoying. Prices were not cheap but I found it very good value for money. Overall it was a great experience and I would recommend St-Urbain to anyone who enjoys good food."}
{"_id": 2, "text": "I had high expectations going here since it's one of the newer places to go in Vegas...We got hooked up with a pretty sweet table right on the dancefloor. Our host was cool and totally on top of her game. Better be for that price!! 3 bottles of vodka later, we were having a great time. We definitely wouldn't have enjoyed it though if we didn't have a table. The line to get in was easy breezy too. I've had experience at other places that we've gotten table at (ahem, PURE) and been treated like shit and had to wait for 2 hours to get in, even though we paid over $1200! So getting in quickly was a huge plus at Moon. Plus you can get in to the Playboy Club too. But we didn't make it that far... :) Views are awesome from the Palms that high up.\\n\\nThe dancefloor was miniscule for a Vegas club and altogether unimpressive. There were not multiple dancefloors or DJs but there were several bar areas, one being outside and quite nice. The roof wasn't open when we were there, except for about 5 minutes later at night (I read somewhere that they open it at 3AM). Since we didn't have to deal with going to the bars I can't judge the prices of drinks nor the bartender's talent. Music was decent; don't remember hating or loving it either way. Only chicks are allowed to dance up on top of the booths. We chose to dance on the benches within our table area, which was a major foot saver from the previous night at Tao. \\n\\nWhat I find particularly strange is that at Tao and Moon, I was stabbed with pieces of glass in my foot! Coincidence? I don't know? Just really odd that two nights in a row, my foot was bleeding from two different broken glasses on the floor. After all my clubbing/bar days, can't say that's EVER happened. I was impressed at Moon though, how the host took care of me immediately and I was \\\"treated\\\" in the back with all the employees to make sure I was OK. My sister got stabbed with glass in her foot too. Weird.,\\n\\nI've been to better clubs elsewhere so I'd have to say I wouldn't return unless we had a table again. And maybe it'd be nice in the summer when it's warm and the roof is open longer. That's it's main gimmick and sounded like a good idea in general.  Tao offers much more, and I've also had a much better time at my many trips to Tryst..."}

I guess with the overflow of people they had to play the same music from the main floor since there was literally no more room to move.  getting out of the club was worse than getting in too.  drinks were pricey but tasty.  but never again will i go to such heights for tao.\\n\\nso i guess its fair.  you can say to yourself that you've experienced tao if you go here.  not really anything unusual than any other club i've been too except the women bathing in tubs in the middle of the stage like a softcore porn movie.  but nowadays you can always download that stuff off the internet."}

{"_id": 3, "text": "Friday night, last minute birthday dinner reservation for a group of 9?  In San Francisco, that would be a near impossible task to accomplish, but Sage was happy to accommodate us! #winning\\n\\nTo start:\\nWe were briefly introduced to the bar before getting seated.  After ordering a round of waters (too hungry to consume alcohol!) and getting acquainted with the menu, our dining experience began with a selection of sourdough bread and bacon bread with herb butter and sea salt.  I love bread and I simply couldn't get enough of these.  Although the bacon bread was a little on the oily side for me and the sourdough was a less sour than the SF variety, I had few complaints once I paired everything with the herb butter and salt.  The server even came around for a second time to offer additional rolls right before our food arrived!  +1 star for sure.\\n\\nNext, we received a complementary amuse-bouche and that was an absolute delight.  The server was soft spoken when introducing the appetizer, however, so I cannot recall exactly what we had. The flavors were subtle and worked well with the cream and sweet fruits. \\n\\nMain courses:\\nChef Shawn McClain's masterful menu includes a number of rich, indulgent, high value items.  Think oysters, sweetbreads, steaks, truffles, scallops, bone marrow...if any of these items make your mouth water, head on over.  Unfortunately, if you're vegetarian, the selection is far less accessible, although items can be modified (and prices adjusted) to accommodate dietary needs.  It was difficult to settle on just one dish, but I could never resist a good duck dish. :)\\n\\nI ordered the duck breast with persimmon puree, spiced rillette, and roasted cauliflower.  The duck is sourced from Grimaud farms, and the meat is noticeably leaner than other duck varieties that I've had.  i appreciated the slightly crispy skin and the sweet-salty contrast of the persimmon-duck.  Excellent flavor, hearty portion, and beautifully prepared!\\n\\nA few other notables: the gnocchi was the dish of the night (4 of us ordered it) and it stands out as a well-executed dish.  The braised wagyu short rib was solid too -- excellent job on the braising. \\n\\nOverall\\n- Everyone was pleased and satiated with the quality of their meal.\\n- The food is rich and you will leave feeling full.\\n- Aside from the soft spoken servers, service was pretty solid and the dining experience was efficient and well paced, allowing us to move on to our evening activities quickly.\\n- Dessert options were primarily cream or ice cream based (and no birthday specials).

When the delivery arrived, the same driver from the previous encounter rolled his eyes when he realized that it was me and was rude but I did not engage him. I ordered two more times after this incident over a two month span and my food was delivered by different people who were very courteous, I even offered one of them water because it was so hot out but he refused. It was the most recent experience that will keep me from EVER ordering from this place again. The same guy from previous negative experiences made the delivery this time and as he was swiping my card, he began sighing and rolling his eyes.

It took us 15 minutes to get our drinks and then another 10 to get our food order in...only because I asked another server to help us.  They cranked the music too loud and it caused it to cut in and out.  We told multiple servers multiple times that if they turned the music down it would go back to normal...took 30 minutes for that to be fixed.  The food was just ok and the presentation was not impressive.  The soup was spilled all over the plate beneath it and they just threw a few tortillas on my friend's burro...seriously no attention to detail in this place.

Okay, now we can talk about the joint.  The first thing that came to mind when I walked in was, this place has some character!  What a refreshing change from the overpopulation of chain restaurants on Ray road.  I was greeted immediately as I walked up to the front door, and the service continued to impress me throughout the entire meal.  I was waiting for my friends to arrive, so I decided to take advantage of the last few minutes of Happy hour and order a hummus tray and PAMI tini (Pomegranate martini). The Martini was very good, not as sweet as most places, which I prefer.  The pita bread on the hummus tray was fantastic, toasted just perfectly.  Of the trio we preferred the chipotle and pesto, the jalape\\u00f1o cilantro was a little bland and surprisingly not spicy.   For dinner we all ended up ordering the same thing, so I can only report on one item.  It was their baked rotollo ... and it was fantastic!  It was like a huge manicotti stuffed with cheese, veggies and pesto, then topped with more cheese and red sauce.... an Italian vegetarians dream!  Fired up grill is a hidden gem in the middle of the chain mafia in Chandler. I'll definitely be back."}

{"_id": 3, "text": "One thing I missed having after living in Iowa is good Mexican food. Finding Mexican cuisine in rural Iowa wasn't difficult, but the range of ingredients, freshness, and flavor often fell short of expectations. On the first visit, I came with fellow Yelpers Angela T, Fia R, and Kurdy S. More recently, I introduced my aunt to this place when she came to visit me. There's plenty of parking in the strip mall. Lighting isn't the best, and the hole in the wall d\\u00e9cor consists of tiled floors, large open kitchen, TVs, and a down to earth vibe. \\n\\nThe first thing interested diners need to know is their specialization in tortas. These gigantic subs are known for their size that probably weighs more than 5 pounds. The Del Rey ($9.50) came fully stacked with ham, cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, refried beans, two hot dogs, chorizo, eggs, tomato, onion, avocado, chipotle sauce, and a plate full of potato chips. There seemed to be no end to this sandwich, as I couldn't even finish half of it. In terms of quality, I liked the overall composition, the soft toasted bread, and the apparent shock effect for the amount of calories this beast carries. However, the refried beans could be more evenly spread, and the breaded beef could be seasoned so it has flavor. It was an item fun to have in group situations, and a novelty to cross off my long and never-ending to-eat list.\\n\\nThe Nopales con Asada ($10.99) came with thick slices of grilled beef, cactus, fresh cheese, guacamole, and my choice of flour tortillas. The beef was juicy, fully marbled, chewy, and flavorful. The cactus was a highlight too, but was slightly over-salted. Food again was plentiful. I couldn't finish it all and had to take the rest to go. I'm likely order this again.\\n\\nThe Chilaquiles ($7) came with fried tortilla, cotija cheese, runny eggs, onions, sour cream, and green and red salsa. The combination was delicious, particularly with the thick runny egg yolks to finesse the crispy textures and sharp salsa. The mix of flavors was still not as excellent as the Chiaquiles at Anepalco's, but it is a dish I would recommend besides the torta. \\n\\nThe Pollo Burro ($6.75) came with chunky chicken, refried beans, pico de gallo, cheese, and avocado. The texture was too wet and mushy. El Farolito has a better burrito, where each ingredient is discernible and better seasoned. I don't recommend it.\\n\\nAnother item I would not recommend is the Cocktel de Camaron Chico ($10.99). It came with shrimp, tomato juice, cilantro, onions, and avocado. The ratio was off as the few shrimps were lost in the tomato juice. The support cast could come chunkier as fillers. I felt like I had gone fishing only to come up empty with a few tiny shrimps. Overpriced and it was awful.\\n\\nThese meals would not be complete unless I hit the 10,000 calories mark. So, for dessert, I highly recommend getting the Chocoflan ($5). It's a custard cake, not too sweet, very moist, and rich in chocolate flavor. It was addictive and easy to finish. \\n\\nFor drinks, I liked the Aguas Frescas Naturales ($3.50). I preferred the watermelon flavor to the cantaloupe, and the non-alcoholic King Margarita ($4.50) was also worth considering as it comes with fresh strawberries with a touch of salt in every sip.\\n\\nThe food took some time to arrive at our table and service was very absent unless we flag down someone to help us. Overall, I thought this restaurant offers a good variety of dishes, and portions were consistently out of this world. However, I have also had better and cheaper Mexican food elsewhere. I would consider this a good place to bring out of town guests looking for hole in the wall experiences. 3.5 stars for both visits, I'd be interested in coming back."}

We came in on a Thursday night to a bar that was, at best, 40% filled. It took 15 minutes for the waitress to even come over and take our drink order (not for lack of trying to get her attention) and another 20 just to get our drinks. Considering we ordered a water and a soda, I was a little disappointed. When the pizza finally arrived, it was a little greasey. My friend got a standard pizza (pepperoni), and I got one of their specialty pies. He was disappointed but I thought the pizza was pretty decent. I just would have liked a refill on my water without having to ask the waitress three times. I worked in food service for many years, so I understand that things can happen. But if that's the wait time on a slow Thursday night, I would hate to be there on a weekend.\\n\\nOverall -- respectable pizza, service that left something to be desired. Probably worth giving a second chance, though."}

I've gotten a few of there combos of burritos, tacos, etc, and while they're good, you are probably going to cross (or very nearly cross) the $10 mark once you add a drink. personally I think the most underrated thing on the menu is the Mexican Pizza. It's a 14\\\" cheese crisp with green chili beef, tomatoes, and green onions. It has plenty of flavor, it's def. filling, and it's cheap - $4.80. (this is also perfect Hangover Grub.)

You cannot delude yourself into thinking you are sticking to your diet at all if you order this.

They pile it with your choice of pork , chicken or beef (I got chicken, fiance got pork.. both were excellent). They also serve it with rice, beans, romaine lettuce, 2 kinds of cheese, guacamole and tortilla crispy strips on top. I could barely finish half of this massive feast, but the half I did eat was quite delicious. Salad prices average ~$8 depending on what meat you pick."}

If you want to party downtown and have the Fremont Street Experience - old school Vegas style - this is not a bad place to be centralized. There are still way more hot females at the hotels & casinos on the strip though since it seems to be more family vacation oriented here. Slipping down the water slide through the shark tank is not as cool as it sounds, but it's fun and faster than it seems. A bit too fast to get a good look at the fishies while going through the tube, but you can swim next to them in the pool (with a glass separator of course). There's a couple of reservation only pools on the upper levels of the swimming area, but they are small and dinky. Gambling doesn't seem too exciting from the crowd and most of the table game workers seem down; we were probably the noisiest ones, but hey, at long as it's fun :p. It sucks that there were no fridge in the bedrooms, so we had to ask for pales of ice. They do leave out a bottle of Fiji water and a box of instant coffee which if you open will cost $7 for the H2O and $10 for the cafe. First thing I did when I came into the room was drank that water because I thought that the hotel was being nice, until my friend told me that we were going to be way overcharged for it. I was also planning to make some coffee afterwards, until the price tag was pointed out - Starbucks down stairs is even cheaper. At least the parking was free for hotel guests."}

{"_id": 0, "text": "How kind of Your Nail Gal Pam to respond to my review. However, she got a few things about me wrong that I'd like to correct. \\n\\nI am not a professional nail client. I'm a regular woman who gets monthly pedicures from an absolutely charming, competent and polite technician. She has never made faces at me, cursed at me, or indicated that I might break her equipment. She also works in a small space, however it is arranged so she and her clients are comfortable. \\n\\nYes, I once wrote a series of articles for Nails Magazine, however, only one was about working with obese clients. I also wrote about hand treatments including plastic surgery, massage, clients with disabilities, luxury pedicure options, language barriers, and did salon reviews. When I was still able to work, I wrote on a number of subjects, including beauty, automotive, and more.  I enjoyed my research and learned a lot. \\n\\nI never came to Pam with gels on my toes, nor did I ever ask her to remove gels that she didn't apply in the first place. She had a policy in place about gels and removals, and I respected that. \\n\\nPam is certainly entitled to set up her salon space however she wishes...it IS her business. However, the pedicure throne is in a fixed position, and I fit on that, so her claim of being a contortionist is strange.\\n\\nShe accused me of exceeding her chair's weight limit. Hmmm. I never mentioned my weight to her, nor did I weigh myself in her salon. Yes, I am fat. That's not easy to hide. And yes, bench style seating is awesome. However, I use pedicure thrones every month with no problem. If she was so concerned about her equipment, she could have asked me not to use it and suggested an alternative. \\n\\nYes, I waited to write this review. I made notes after each visit, hoping to figure out what I could do to unleash this super tech that so many were swooning about.  I dare say none of the beauty pros I work with now would consider me an undesirable client. True, my diabetes and severe arthritis might make me a challenge, but with open dialogue and common courtesy on both sides of the chair, issues are easily resolved. \\n\\nIf Pam makes you happy and makes your nails gorgeous, then good for you. We all have choices. But if your experiences were more like mine, don't feel bad or embarrassed or think you did something wrong. There are plenty of nail techs out there who welcome clients who are differently abled. The tech I use now provides incredible, relaxing massage that makes me drool. Pam just made me sad and humiliated."}

After grabbing a cup of coffee at Starbucks, I sat down and began to dissect my cupcake.   The vanilla cupcake was filled with a chocolate ganache, topped with chocolate and vanilla buttercream.   The cupcake was moist, but the cream was a tad bit dense and way too sweet.  I would have enjoyed it more with a beer, but the sweet cupcake didn't go so well with my caramel macchiato; way too much sugar to start the day!  The cream frosting was just too thick and heavy for my liking, and too sweet.  The cupcake was $3.75 plus tax, which came out to be $4.08...honestly since when do they start charging tax on cupcakes!?  \\n\\n For the price of the cupcake, I did not think it was worth $4.  I would have been better off going to Jean Phillipe or Payard and getting a sweet dessert or a pastry.   Other cupcake places like Sprinkles make better cupcakes than here, but so far I have not found too many cupcake shops on the strip in Vegas.   I guess if you have a cupcake craving these cupcakes might satisfy your appetite, but don't expect these cupcakes to be breathtaking delicious.

It's like they read my mind! I also was in love with the pork belly with pumpkin and fennel...so autumnal! The dish was pretty greasy but hey, it's a chunk of pure animal fat, so what's a little bit of extra grease, really? Other than that it was ridic tasty. The homemade soda was also fabulous though it would definitely taste better with vodka (why do they only have two cocktails on the menu? and one is tequila-based? bummer).\\n\\nThe one part of my meal that fell short was the Rieger Pork Soup. The concept is perfection--french onion soup with pork. Where could that go wrong? Unfortunately, the soup was completely devoid of flavor. Once I dumped half the salt shaker in it, it became edible, but the main problem was that the onions were not caramelized at all. Topped with a bland slice of cheese, it was the only disappointment of my meal.\\n\\nI do have to say, all the raves about the atmosphere are kind of off. I could imagine it being a great lunch spot with all the natural light coming through the windows, but at dinnertime, the lights were WAY too bright.

Dance floor is a good size. Well lit also, so you can actually see if you really have a dime on the dance floor or a buzzard. Not crowded at all which was fine by mine. You could actually get to the bathroom in under 1 minute."}

It's about the tacos (that should always have cilantro and onions), and the gorditas, and the sopes, and the tostadas. Kind of excited to try the chorizo/potato option next time around. I love sopes, and while these are different than the TG version, they are also very good. Thick, fried (?) corn-pita type things topped with your choice of meat plus lettuce, tomato and avocado. Yum. \\n\\nThey have good chips and salsa too. Ask for the bottled salsa too, as it's spicier and a little more interesting than the standard pico de gallo. Also have to love getting a filling lunch for 5 or 6 bucks. The servers are really nice and helpful as well."}

The soda fountain has exposed lines and an open drainage system, very unsightly. \\n\\nAs I am standing there waiting 10 minutes for someone to take our order I started looking around the place.  The walls are dirty, I cannot even guess the last time the fryers were moved in order to clean the old food and filth underneath them.  The fryers have old caked on grease on the sides, again couldn't even fathom a guess as to when it was cleaned last.

Sadly, there was only 3 tickets ahead of ours.  We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.  I knew I should have insisted when go somewhere else but my wife really wanted to try the place out.  I had to drive straight home and I spent the next 30 minutes vomiting.

My guy went for a meal with one of his buddies here a couple of weeks prior and raved about it so much that I forced him to take me one evening when we were able to peel ourselves off the floor.\\nHe reported that the beers were quite pricey so we opted for a bottle of white wine.  The white wine selection was pretty limited and not cheap (we ordered the cheapest bottle at something like \\u00a315.00), and I regret to say that we were most assuredly not impressed with our choice.  \\n\\nOur food, however, more than made up for it.  I love tapas because I love variety.  We ordered three or four dishes each and enjoyed every bite.  I would love to go into detail but have a memory like a sieve and can't remember what we ordered off the top of my head.  I would be pretty confident, though, that anything you order here will be grat.    \\n\\nThe problem with Dionika is that no one ever goes here.  I honestly don't know how they survive.  I have NEVER seen it full.  It's one of those things where people don't go there because it's always empty, but of course it's always empty because no one goes there.  \\n\\nWe keep wanting to go back but walk by and it's so dead that we decide to go somewhere else.  I think maybe everyone who likes this place need to agree on a night to go there so we can have great food AND good atmosphere!\\n\\nOne other oddity - at the end of our meal the owner/chef came out and made his chatty round of the dining room (all three tables).  He was very spirited and certainly loves his restaurant.  He was a bit eccentric, but gave us complimentary booze so our hearts were won over.\\n\\nEdit:  I forgot to mention that the meal (including 15 pounds for a bottle of wine) was 40 pounds.

The mini Creme Brulee wasn't very impressive, and a bit pricey at over $4 for a small serving.

Mine came with a breadlike object on top and when questioned, he said, it's a cracker stick, like that was okay. When I picked up the bowl and handed it back to him, he started to remove the crumbly stick, like that would now make my contaminated salad gluten free. Then, the crumbs fell into my daugher's Caprese salad, so both had to be reordered. My daughter's dish was not correct, nor was her pasta side, so they remade the pasta. Gluten free pasta cannot be al dente, but this was. I found a piece of non gluten free pasta mixed in with mine, leading me to suspect they make the gluten free with the regular pasta.

The property opened in early 2009 so everything is new, clean, and does not have any peculiar smells like most hotels do.  The rooms are spacious with comfy beds, flat screen TVs and glass shower stalls. The toiletries are from the same Bliss collection as you would find at higher priced parent chain. \\n\\nAnother shocker -- the bottle of water in the room is complimentary!!!  It's the small things that count; I am unfortunately used for that little bottle to be $5.  Also, free wired and wireless internet throughout the property, a 24/7 gym, a (tiny) pool, a bar, and a little snack area. Minimalistic modern design, funky music, and trippy floor panels in the elevators. The hotel is located right in the Epicenter so you're within crawling distance of all the hopping clubs and restaurants as well as the office buildings where you need to drag your sorry a$$ in the morning. \\n\\nFinally, the nightly rate is about $40-$50 cheaper than any other property in the surrounding few blocks.\\n\\nThe reason I took off one star is the loud beast of an A/C system in the room that is hard to tame (there's digital control for the unit but it's pretty finicky).

They had stuffed cherry peppers - those were soooo awesome.  But, the GF didnt love that one. \\n\\nI ordered the steak frites because I really wanted the pomme frites.  The meat was tough and not really tasteful.  Fries - overcooked and really just not that good.  The sauce was good, but cold.  Overall, my meal was not really that good.  My girlfriend got the special, which was veal hangar steak, shrimp riscotto and sauteed asparagus.  The veal was good, but the sauce just sucked in my opinion.  It had a liquorice flavor, and I don't dig on that.  The asparagus was the best part of the meal.  \\n\\nWe also got a bottle of french wine.  It was a merlot cab franc blend.

{"_id": 0, "text": "My husband and I recently went to Mt.Charleston to play in the snow. We stopped in to the restaurant to get some lunch. We had been to A Cut Above on several occasions. On this occasion, the restaurant was only about half full. The lobby of the hotel was packed with people trying to get warm. There was a long line of people waiting to get in to the restaurant. The hostess ran around the restaurant, frantic, although the place was only half full. A couple in front of me was told that the wait was 20 minutes. I inquired about the wait and said to the hostess that I couldn't understand why there was a long wait when there were so many open tables. She then told me that it would only be a 5-minute wait. She was very overwhelmed...why, I have no clue. You would think that with the snow, the restaurant would have a plan in place for an influx of people.\\n\\nI have to say that this restaurant is becoming more and more shabby in appearance over time. My husband and I sat at a table with chairs that didn't match. The carpet and windows are dirty. Then our waiter appeared. He looked and acted like Lerch from the Addams Family. He had zero personality, provided terrible service and would come to our table, look at it, take things away without a word. It was very bizarre. The food was mediocre at best, definitely not worth the price. \\n\\nI must add that a couple sat down at a table behind us shortly after we arrived. We shared the same strange waiter. Our food arrived and we were finished (in the span of about 50 minutes) and their food had not even arrived. To say that they were frustrated is an understatement.\\n\\nOh, and then there was the joy of getting the check. I asked Lerch for the bill and waited more than 15 minutes for it. Finally, when the manager walked by my table, I asked him for it. he brought it with a to-go pizza box. He held it out to me blankly and said, \\\"Do you know how to put this box together? I have no clue.\\\" Really????\\n\\nA Cut Above, in my opinion, doesn't even begin to make the cut. The restaurant has so much wasted potential. I will not return and waste my time or money."}

So, I arrived at 4 (when is was pretty dead), got seated quickly and waited on nicely. Nothing to complain about in the service. Ordered coke (got a large mug) and their \\\"sampler\\\" appetizer. This had onion shreds, fried pickles, burnt ends, and some potato skin things. Onion shreds were like all others I've had, pickles were too--so I have to question if they were frozen. Burnt ends weren't \\\"real\\\" burnt ends, just boneless--sometimes pure fat--that have been smoked and slathered in sauce. Good, but not true burnt ends. The potato skin things were decent, but the pork, cheese, and whatnot tasted all the same, so it's kind bland.\\nMy entree was baby-back ribs, brisket, and white meat smoked chicken. I LOVED the wing off the chicken--tender, juicy, flavorful. BUT, the breast meat of the chicken was dry as all hell. Brisket wasn't sliced, and tasted like it had been sitting around. Why not slice brisket? Seriously? Half of it tasted like I was eating tree bark. With the half-rack of ribs, the \\\"towards the center\\\" was tender, but low on flavor. The other side \\\"towards the end\\\" was pretty tough. There was an overall lack of smoke flavor, and flavor at all, from the ribs. (I sampled ribs at Sprouts--a grocer--and found their ribs to be much better). So a chain focused on their awards on ribs fell pretty short here for me. My sides were macaroni and cheese--which had some cheddar velveta--and rice and beans, which was fine but not great.\\nThey do have sauces on the side, but they're too runny to actually stay on the meat, and while the flavor is good, you can't taste it on the meat as the sauces are too watered down.\\nIn the end, It would have cost me close to $50 for all of this, not including tip, and I just don't see the worth in that. Nothing blew me away.\\n\\nIf you're hard set on this place, go for their chicken wings, burnt ends, and maybe ribs.\\nBut, if you're looking, go somewhere else since you'll get better for your money."}

My Ribeye just lacked flavor, plain and simple. On the side we shared the Potato Tarte Tatin, Broccolini & Cavatappi Pasta, \\\"Mac & Cheese\\\", Quebec Cheddar.

It seemed to me like they try to make this place feel a little more inviting, it could just be that the place had wood floors and and a different feel when they leased the place but it works. \\n\\nI presented my shotgun to the clerk on duty and he was very knowledgeable and friendly when it came to researching the gun and giving me a strait forward answer. He had mentioned that He could put it on the shelves but due to where we live and what people want that unless it is an assault rifle that looks like the ones in the video games it will probably sit for quite some time but he would recommend listing it myself on Gun Broker and sure enough I did and it sold.\\n\\nA took a few minutes to chat with the guy before walking around and checking out accessories, which I must add, they were definitely not cheaper than other shops when it came to those. I priced a Black Hawk Paddle holster and it was insanely marked up but the guns seem to be okay. \\n\\nI would go back here if I needed to consign something or get some quick gun advice but no necessarily for accessories or ammo"}

I ordered the creme brulee shake, turkey burger and my friend (the great lover he is-lol) had a Sam burger and we shared the sweet potato fries. \\n\\nThe shake did not taste nothing like creme brulee, it was just plain ol vanilla shake, nothing special about this shake. I could have passed on it but hey wouldnt have known what it taste like until I tried it. \\n\\nMy lover-friend really liked his burger, but wished it would have came with fries automatically. My burger was ok, again I was not blown away by it. The sweet potato fries were good as always with the dipping sauce. \\n\\nI thought everything was ok. I kinda look at it like an ''upscale burger joint'' and I am using that term loosely.

We were seated right away and got our drinks right away.  Restaurant did not seem overly busy to me. We had some questions about the menu, got them answered and placed our order.\\n\\nWe ordered the Paradise Valley Omelette and the Steak and Eggs.  It took 27 minutes for them to deliver our first entree'. The omelette was hot off the press, steaming and had some really nice hot, stringy cheese.  The Steak and Eggs was a completely different story.  The steak was cold, overcooked and tough.  Enough said so I sent it back. My next entree' (Eggs Benedict) came out in 5 minutes and it looked great.  However, the English Muffin was barely toasted, the ham was super thin, and the Hollandaise was tasty but it basically formed a pool on the plate.\\n\\nThere were some positives.  We ordered a side of the Jalepeno Bacon and it was really good.  I had the side of Biscuits and Gravy on the Steak and Eggs entree and the biscuits were good.  You could tell they were homemade.  Also, the homemade sausage gravy was great.\\n\\nOur waitress was really great and really seemed to know the menu well.  She did comp the Eggs Benedict entree after we talked about how weak the Steak and Eggs came out from the kitchen.\\n\\nThe food runner needed some help in a big way....I just kept seeing him flash in and out of the kitchen and running through the dining room. \\n\\nThe bakery items looked really good so I might go back to try them sometime in the future. \\n\\nOverall, I'd say about 2.5 stars but I've definitely had better breakfasts at other restaurants in the area.

I cannot give then 4 stars for simple mistakes and high prices. Not worth the high prices for the food delivered. Go someplace else. I'm still searching for a steakhouse that is worth the prices which they charge.  I think going to Outback Steakhouse you may end up with better food and service!

The man who helped us said they could not take us as they were pretty busy. Totally understandable considering it was a Saturday. But it was the way he treated us that was very poor. I get that you are too busy to take us but how about exercising a little customer service and helping us schedule a later time or next day. He was very rude and dismissive. It was kind of embarrassing considering there was people all around us. Despite this we decided to try again the next day. I called and made an appt with the man who answered the phone. Not sure if it was same guy. We made it for last appt of the day. When we arrived two young ladies greeted us but could not find our appt. again instead of trying to accommodate us they just said we didn't have an appt so they couldn't take us. Then they said that we called the wrong salon. I tried to show them the number I called on my phone log but they refused to look at it. I checked it with the number on the store brochure and window and I had called the correct store. I told them this but no answer. Again no one tried to reschedule or even apologize for the confusion.

{"_id": 0, "text": "My letter to Wells Fargo:\\n\\nWells Fargo\\nAttn: Branch Manager\\n3002 N Central Ave\\nPhoenix, AZ, 85012\\n\\nTo Whom it May Concern,\\n\\nI understand the customer is NOT always right. I understand that I am not now, nor will I ever be your best, most profitable customer. I don't make a lot of money, I am living paycheck to paycheck and barely making ends meet. I am trying to get back on my feet to where I can live without floating one bill to pay another. I have a Second Chance account and I am trying to do the best so I can transition to a regular account. But none of this means your employees have the right to treat me like a second class citizen. You have to understand that in customer service, when a customer has a good experience, they tell one to two people. When the customer has a great experience they tell 3 to 4 people. On the opposite end of the spectrum. When a customer has a bad experience, they tell 10 to 12 people and when they have a horrible experience, they take to social media where they are visible to hundreds or even thousands of people. \\nI am a relatively new customer to Wells Fargo. Since opening my accounts, I have been in several times for various transactions, usually depositing a paycheck (which are now direct deposited), and have really always received world-class service from your employees from the moment I would walk in, to the moment I left.\\nYesterday was a completely different story. I will start by apologizing, as I was out of line at the end of the transaction. I drove off and flipped the teller off. I strongly feel though, that my actions at the END of this transaction do NOT validate your employees' treatment of me at the BEGINNING of the transaction. I was in a great mood because I finally received my tuition assistance check for $3669.00 from Arizona State University where I am a student. I rushed over to make it to your branch before they closed. I went through the drive through, only wanting to deposit this check. My friend and I waited for 10 minutes. The teller never apologized for the wait or explained what the hold up was, she just left us waiting. I am still in a great mood at this point though. Finally she comes back and advises simply that my check is being held. I ask why and until what date. This is when the conversation goes downhill. She tells me it is on hold until Tuesday because I have a Second Chance Bank Account and the check is from Bank of America and if I don't like that, I can go next door to Bank of America. \\nAre you kidding me? Her first reaction is to tell me to take my business elsewhere?? Who does that?? She was so condescending and rude I was shocked. But I let it go and collected my ID, debit card and receipt. I noticed the receipt read the deposit was $3669 and that $3469 was being held. I pressed the call button and asked the teller about the $200 difference. She was clearly irritated with me at that point and tells me the entire amount is on hold as it clearly states on my receipt. I tell her its not clear on my receipt, that's why I am asking. She responds by telling me she is going to get her manager. What? Are you serious? Up to now, I have not talked back to her, I have not raised my voice, I have been completely respectful. The manager comes over. I try asking my questions again and she cuts me off saying as it clearly states on your receipt sir, the entire amount is being held. I say again, its not clear on my receipt. She again cuts me off and tells me its clear on my receipt. She cut me off and repeated herself 3 times. I was so furious I drove off and that is when I flipped her off. Again my apologies, but again, this does not validate how I was treated. I went into the branch as soon as they opened this morning and spoke with a manager. As soon as I told her I had gone through the drive through last night, she stopped me and said oh, \\\"you're the guy that flipped off my employees?\\\" and proceeds to lecture me as though I am a child and basically threatened to kick me out of the branch. Again, I had not raised my voice this entire time. She finally lets me explain what happened, and though she is verbally apologetic, it is clear she could absolutely care less. In fact, several times, she kept saying I don't know why they would have talked to you like that, I don't know what the circumstances were. There were no circumstances that I should have EVER been treated like that. Yes I flipped them off, but that was at the very end of the transaction as I was driving away. The manager never asked for my name or phone number, never said she would get back to me if she has other questions. She was just giving me lip service, and barely made any real effort at that.\\nNormally I can forgive and forget, but these two interactions from three employees are unforgivable and I am now questioning my loyalty as a customer.\\nWhat reason do I have to stay?\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nLucas R."}

My boyfriend's filet was over cooked and dry, and 3/4 of mine was perfect and the other end was almost raw. My boyfriend loved his huge ravioli and I thought mine was gross.   Dessert was a white chocolate covered strawberry and a very tasty petite four and a glass of champagne. \\n\\nEvery course had some sort of alcohol infused in it, except the pears and with my glass of included champagne and my glass of wine I was nearly drunk by the time the check came.\\n\\nI would go eat there again on a non holiday, because the items that were good, were SO good. They were just overbooked and frazzled.  \\nOne couple came and never had a waiter check on them and THEY LEFT - which I have never seen before, especially on Valentines Day.\\n\\nIt's worth going to for the experience."}

Jacqueline's menu has chocolate chip pancakes, asian rice bowls, deli sandwiches, Mexican dishes and a crazy smattering of other options. Can one establishment really be that adept at all cusines? I think not.\\n\\nI had a lunch date with a friend who was visiting so after picking her up at the Scottsdale Hilton I decided this was a close place to try.  My friend had the tuna wrap which was mayo city (she could only eat half of it) and after scowering the menu for healthy pescatarian/vegetarian options (I think only the Greek salad lacked chicken) I decided on the fish tacos.  I know ordering fish tacos at a restuarant that doesn't claim to be southwestern or Mexican was risky but nothing else really appealed to me! The tacos were ok...small bits of fish torn up inside flour tortillas with salsa, lettuce and \\\"Mexican\\\" rice on the side. The portion itself was huge so I definitely got my money's worth but the food was just \\\"MEH\\\"! I liked the fruity iced tea though. Maybe this place is better for breakfast?

They have an abundant amount of crab legs, different types of sushi, shrimp, salmon, mahi mahi etc. \\n\\nThe buffet is international and so you have your pick of what types of food you want to sample from around the world. I enjoyed their different types of Thai curry (panang, green, and yellow). I also became an instant fan of tomato soup here. \\n\\nOne of the best things about the buffet is the desert section. \\nThey have cannolis, gelato, crepes, creme brulee, flan and much, much more. \\n\\nAnother bonus point of the buffet is they offer free wine and free cappuccino, lattes and other speciality coffees at their buffet. \\n\\nLastly, I noticed that within the casino itself they would have a raffle almost every 15 minutes. They would call out the numbers of different casino card holders and the winners would win cool prizes like trips to Big Bear, $10,000 etc. I'm not sure how authentic the raffle is since we noticed the numbers always called out seemed to be a way lower number then what any of the card holders had on their cards (at least for the party I was with =P) but hey if it is for real...it's pretty cool. \\n\\nAnyways this place is pretty rockin! Classy looking and excellent food. I can easily see it working it's way to become a new hot spot for Vegas :)"}

{"_id": 3, "text": "My first trip. Located on second floor of the Cromwell. \\n\\nTips. This place takes reservations. Most dinner times of 5-9 are a two month out for a reservation. Lunch recently began to be served. Lunch dress code is relaxed and dinner is business casual. Dress code is enforced.\\n\\nExperience. At arrival we are greeted immediately at the base of stairs to confirm our lunch reservation. Also confirmed and greeted at the front desk. She kindly informs us to wait a few moments to try the photo booth to the left and are escorted to our tables.\\n\\nOur server Anthony arrived in a timely manner to introduce himself and his help. He was kindly insured we placed a drink order. We were unsure on what to order and he described some of his favorite beverage choices. Giada's Sangria with Brachetto and Fortunella 1958 with Don Julio were the drinks we ordered. Anthony kindly informed us that restaurant was out of Don Juilo and was substituting with Patron. Rare to find a restaurant out of beverage. Without Don Julio I went with my second choice Barbarella 1968 with Tanqueray Ten. Waiter respected and agreed with my opinion and affirmed the second choice was his favorite drink. \\n\\nDrinks were served and food order was taken without delay. Both drinks I would describe as a good balance with alcohol and freshly matched ingredients. Sangria was crisp and savory. Barbarella similar to a Moscow Mule was harmony of gin, ginger beer, fresh lemon and basil. Drinks ordered were refreshing for the hot temperatures outside of the restaurant. Alcohol was not over powering either. \\n\\nAnthony made suggestions for the meal. We followed some suggestions and ordered others. We ordered appetizers from the antipasti meat and cheese including Chicken Marsala Meatballs, and Pecorino Tartufo with Apricot Preserves served with fresh made flat bread and dipping sauce. Dipping sauce similar to that of a pesto. Yum. Pairing flat bread with pecorino and apricot spread just magnificent. The components of pecorino worked well on its own and together. Harmony. \\n\\nMeatballs paired with vine roasted tomatoes in a savory Marsala. Tender soft meatballs. Sauce was flavorful and one of the best I had. Tomatoes lightly toasted to maintain it's integrity. As a whole this was a nice antipasti. Pieces were good on its own but in my opinion lacked a little cohesion for the appetizer. This item is on their dinner menu and I would still order it. \\n\\nWe ordered from the sandwiches from servers suggestions. Muffuletta sandwich with mortadella, finocchoina, porchetta, prosciutto cotto, and aged provolone. Similar to an Italian salumi trio, was bursting with spice and fair amount of provolone on a fresh rustic bread. Prepared warm from the grill, this is what a  sandwich should be. This sandwich pays true homage to the influences of Giada's family into the restaurant. Sandwich is served with choice of arugula salad or zucchini scapecce. Arugula salad was elected to pair with this. Lightly dressed and topped with parmesan that hit an accord with the sandwich. I couldn't complain if this was the only thing I ordered. Between the muffuletta sandwich and arugula salad I think I could eat all day without feeling guilty.\\n\\nOther sandwich was the Lobster Roll with lemon basil aioli and fried capers. The roll was by far one of the best deals on the menu. Ten ounces of lobster piled on a roll with the citrus aioli was succulent, creamy, savory, and sweet. Nothing over powering just right and not too aromatic with the lobster and citrus. Paired this with the zucchini scapecce like a zucchini onion strings. Not greasy but crispy enough with flavor to enjoy on it's own or pair with the lobster roll. Lightness of the zucchini paired nicely to the sandwich. Both light sides were good pairings. \\n\\nOverall the appetizers, sandwiches, sides, and drinks were great. Service was outstanding. Restaurant as a whole was refreshing, exceeded the expectations and hype. The restaurant reflects the pride, tradition which tributes to Giada's family and California influences. I would make sure I had a reservation the next time I am out to Las Vegas. A must try if you like food. \\n\\nServer was very personal and knowledgeable of menu. Server was efficient, friendly, and well articulated. It showed with suggestions. We enjoyed the meal from some suggestions he made and our own selections. Serve, wait, and host staff worked well like a oiled machine or an orchestra on key.\\n\\nOverall four stars for exceptions from a slight delay on the check to get to us, a little pricy, and no clue what lunch was because lunch menu (just started serving lunch) was not available until we ate there. Five stars on food, service, and drinks. \\n\\nWe had plenty on our list of things to do for this Vegas trip and this is a definite return place for us."}

The sandwich was tasty but the quiche had a weird texture. The food took about 15 minutes longer than our coffee to arrive. The food items were $7.75 and that seemed WAY overpriced since they were tiny.\\nOverall, I would get coffee from here again, but for a grand total of almost $27, it is so not worth it.

{"_id": 0, "text": "I've never had any desire to be here. I actually had no idea it was a place to be. I didn't even know where it was to be honest... I had just heard about it... just that it existed by name. Nothing more. Had I seen the reviews here before going, I might not have even bothered. \\n\\nA friend of mine was working the whole Fashion Week thing and somehow scored us these amazing $400 all-access VIP Super Passes to the whole thing including the after party held at the W. \\n\\nThe downtown area was a traffic congestion nightmare so it took awhile to get a place to park. They were holding a red velvet rope line show at the main entrance to the hotel where all the cars pull up. So elegant and fancy. We waited outside amidst the fumes and fancy rides for our turn to enter with our super passes for what seemed like forever. \\n\\nAlas, it was not meant to be as the guy at the door (read: giant useless turd in a suit) finally told my lady friend that he can only let girls in that don't have guys with them... and apparently only if they pass a certain age, boob job, slutty dress set of standards that only exist in this guy's head. Some guys were getting in, but only models from the show pretty much. \\n\\nI tried to convince my friend to just leave so we could go someplace I actually like, but she was wanting to prove a point on principal. She confronted him a few times about his being a soulless anus, but he didn't wouldn't change his position about us. \\n\\nI should've stepped in and said \\\"look - we've been standing here long enough - either let us the hell in or tell us we aren't welcome here even with our $400 all-access VIP super passes so we can fuck off to someplace better where we don't have to look at your shitty face, you hack.\\\" \\n\\nIn the end our time was wasted. Elitism won and we finally gave up since there was only an hour left of the night and the line had dwindled to only a few dozen people unfit to enter the exclusive party. My friend was too upset to salvage the energy to go to another place. She actually was over the whole Scottsdale thing and insisted that this was representative of the whole city - I was unable to assure her it wasn't (but I assure you it isn't). We hugged a sad goodnight right there in the W carport and went our separate ways. \\n\\nIt's easy to say I didn't really want to be in there in the first place - well, I really didn't. I was just interested in having a drink with a friend and catching up. The W just wasn't meant to be the venue to host such an event. \\n\\nI never got to see the inside from the inside, but I'm pretty sure it smelled like shit covered in puke in there and was likely covered in some sort of sticky film that only drips off of the most hoity of toity. It's not that I'm jealous because I was already hanging out with all these same fake assholes at Fashion Week an hour earlier - I don't know that a change of scenery would really make them that much more compelling and interesting. In fact, I'm sure it wouldn't. It's just that I don't like places that judge you worthy or unworthy of coming in. It's demoralizing and insulting. Even if they had let us in, I would've felt the same way. \\n\\nPretentiousness is next to ugliness. \\n\\nIf I had actually paid $400 for that VIP Super Pass and not been let in to the party immediately, I'd be pretty livid. Since it was free, I can't be that mad - but the rope guy didn't know I got the passes for free. We were dressed nice and we're all fairly attractive people. Maybe I'm too old or too fat or didn't have on an Ed Hardly or Affraction shirt. Maybe this dude just didn't like the cut of my jib. No telling why for sure, but I certainly wouldn't have waited more than 5 minutes if it wasn't for my friend wanting to get in. It's just not something I do. \\n\\nSo I didn't get to see the inside of this place from the inside - just the car port with the parade of Escalades, sports cars and exhaust fumes. I'm sure it's pretty nice in there, but the only thing I'm willing to wait in line for that long is Space Mountain at Disneyland. I'm pretty sure there's nothing nearly as great inside this shallow pit of pseudo cool as fucking Space Mountain. \\n\\nBlow me, W... you $#&@"}

Also I like that you can buy nice teas and drink it out back.They close too early and are not open 7 days a week just 4 which sucks."}

We came in and it was 100 degree outside, we were all tired and hungry.  Then this family came and cut in, this lady ( the mom) cut in with a straight face and didn't even care cause she knows she's doing it on purpose. My husband told her husband we were in line but I said to him it's ok cause they were only party of 3 and we have 6 in our group anyway. Then I told my husband, \\\"just be grateful your not married to that kind of woman.\\\" And the husband heard, the husband and her kid was embarrassed by that woman's attitude. People, don't embarrass your family just for a table! Anyway, so we got our table....our waitress asked what we want for a drink, I gave her our order and I said that's all and I said \\\"That's all\\\"....and she said, \\\"that's all you are going to order\\\". And I'm thinking for a drink \\\"yes\\\". She left and I saw her whispering to another waitress, and I'm like..... hmmmm???? Then I came close To her register and asked to sing for my daughter, so she said to order a desert, so I did and she  brought the sundae with a candle and DIDN'T even sing to my daughter.... She just left it on our table. So we just sang to my daughter, just us!!!! How RUDE!!!! Our waitress is this black lady, that looks like a unemployed stripper/semi retired prostitute. And she's also too slow!!! Then we were waiting to order, looking at their yummy looking food. And we can't understand why she's taking too long to come back. After 30 minutes she came back with a receipt!!!! WTF!!!!! There's six of us and we only ordered drinks and you thought that's all we're ordering!!!! Dumb waitress!!!! We're celebrating my daughter's birthday!!! Anyway we were so pissed that we just decided to leave. This place is understaff..... their sundae are too sweet, the frozen chocolate drink that everyone is talking about is too grainy. YuKkk!!! And they have one dumb black waitress that needs training. I can't believe I didn't check her name. The other waitress seem nice and faster. But she's just too slow and obviously this place is under staff. They overcharge people and their understaff. Ridiculous!!!! Never will I come to this place again!"}

I wasn't expecting much and the only reason I decided to even give it a try is that we had a 2 for 1 coupon. It was very below average food. The only thing I enjoyed was the steamed rice and fried popcorn shrimp but that's not saying a whole lot considering these two dishes are not very hard to make at all. The eggs were terrible and desserts were not tasty at all. On top of all that, we had stomach aches afterwards. I'm sorry to say that I don't think anyone can pay me to eat here again..."}

I'm a bartender myself and I'm usually pretty understanding and like to give people the benefit of the doubt but I've never received such awful service in my life. My gf and I sat at the bar, ALL of the bartenders were very inattentive. The best service I received was from the expos. My tacos came out wrong, they reordered them and the new ones came out quickly but the meat was burnt and I had to send them back once more. The bartenders weren't paying any attention so it took three times longer than it should have. I ordered a margarita with no sweet and sour, the bartender gave me a super confused look. I told him specifically tequila, lime juice, agave and soda and he still gave me a confused look with some attitude. Once I received the margarita i tasted it and it wasn't the best but I was so over complaining that I sucked it down anyways. There was a female bartender working also and disregarded my gf and I but was paying attention to all of the male patrons. I don't ask for a lot, I just want good service. If the service was good I probably wouldn't have even complained about the tacos. They would have received at least three stars if the service would have been decent but unfortunately it was the worst service I've ever received and that says a lot since I come from the same industry and I'm usually very understanding. Monty in particular was the one giving us the worst service. He didn't bother to check on us once. It took over ten minutes to close out my tab and the only reason it didn't take longer was because one of the new female bartenders who had just clocked on was nice enough to ask how I was doing and she closed out my tab. The service was awful the food was ehh and I won't be coming back the next time I visit Tempe."}

{"_id": 0, "text": "I take my Yelp reviews very seriously.  To me, giving someone a one star yelp review means that they have done something so egregious, that someone either did or could have gotten hurt as a result.  Oh wait...that's exactly what happened.  I recently flew into Phoenix with my brother, his husband and their 11 month old baby for a family wedding.  We rented an SUV with a car seat.  Initially, my brother asked if the car seat could be installed for them, as they were unfamililar with this model, and they were told company policy dictates that they could not install the seat.  Fine.  No big deal.  We install the seat and off we go to our hotel to rest up for the drive to Sedona the next day.  \\n\\nMy brother's husband had a nagging feeling about the seat that just wouldn't go away.  Finally, he drove to the local police station to have it inspected and we were informed that Hertz had neglected to include the base of the carseat and that it was in fact, unsafe to hold a child.  A quick call to Hertz later and I KID YOU NOT, we were informed that it was not negligence on their part, it was negligence on our part for driving off with the car seat that they had provided.  Are you counting?  We have two strikes so far.  Massive error that could have led to death of child (that's gotta count for at least 10 strikes though...right) and then complete failure to take responsibility or attempt to fix the problem.  The bro in law located a nearby Hertz location, and they said we could come and pick up a new seat.  They gave us a new seat, they sure did.  Once again, I kid you not, this one was missing clips.  \\n\\nWe made our way back to the original Hertz location at the airport.  The staff were rude, and spent a great deal of time rolling their eyes at us when we asked them for assistance putting a strange car seat into a car that we'd never seen before.  I understand they can't actually install it for liability purposes, but I can't believe that no one else has struggled to install an unfamiliar seat in an unfamiliar car.  Regardless, we never once received an apology, just continued rude behavior and eye rolls.  I travel often and have never encountered such poor customer service and lack of concern for safety at a car rental agency.  You can be sure that Hertz will never receive mine, my family's or any of my friends' business again.  You can bet that they will never receive the business of random people who I run into on the street.  This is how infuriated I am by their negligience and egregious mishandling of the whole situation."}

Also, the automatic blinds didnt work we had to have somebody come up and take a look at it and that took over an hr.  Room was HOT we turned it down to 65 still was warm u have to turn it down to like 61 there is no medium point.

Nothing special and the vibe outside in the regular pool was for like OLD grandma and grandpas.  Some music would of been nice.  Waitresses were average looking nothing special.

We were able to end our day with a drive out there, and made it just before close. They did have a diner where you could eat, but passed. Although it was very quaint, the reviews on food were mediocre. But, people were raving about the pies. They still had a great selection,tons of pies to choose from, even though it was the end of the day. We bought a whole pie, which are a little pricey, but well worth it, for the 2 of us to share. It did not last long! Plus a sticky bun, and another one piece of pie (which is nice when you cant choose) We were so disappointed at the thought of not being able to bring some home for our friends and family to try- so it will be a top recommendation to anyone we know going to visit the phoenix area. Although you could get them shipped, the shipping is astronomical, but at least will give us something to look forward to when on vacation in Arizona.

I love it, but my grandmother, who accompanied us one evening, didn't. They have a nice, quieter outdoor area to sit and enjoy meals as well. The food has plenty to offer. My favorites are their ceviches, the halibut and the shrimp are both excellent, their sides (beans and corn are solid) and their salads. I've tried each salad and enjoyed all of them. They offered a special beet salad last week that was probably the best salad I've ever had: golden beets, red beets, capers, strawberries, goat cheese, balsamic, and more made for an amazing, memorable dish that I hope they will add as a more frequent menu addition. They also offer a Chef's Table reservation for groups of 6 or more that I am looking forward to trying someday. \\nWhat I love most about this place is the fresh quality ingredients and their commitment to local, organic produce. It's fairly healthy grub, yet still tasty so I leave satisfied, but not feeling like I need to go run eight miles afterwards.\\nAreas where I feel they can still improve? Service is critical to a restaurant's success. They are getting better, but still need to improve on consistency. The tres leches cake, while very good, was smaller than my wife and me had expected so it was a very quick desert. Also, some of our dinner companions have been a little surprised at the small taco sizes (they're really street tacos). I recommend the shrimp, short rib, carne asada, or veggie, however the chicken tacos have tasted pretty plain. But, you definitely need at least three or four to fill the average eater. All in all, I really enjoy eating at Taco Haus and feel like they are improving every time I visit, which goes to show that their chef and management are committed to serving the very best food they can."}

Tasted very dry, frozen and old.  The dessert was amazing.  Would give it 5 out of 5 stars.\\n\\nThat being said, I probably would not return to Emeril's Eatery.

But the second time (which was on the same week) just failed. The lady at the burrito area was talking crap in spanish calling us stupid and mentally slow. Now this is all due to a warmed up tortilla that she had to throw away. We ordered two burritos, when she was done making the first i politely asked to change the order to carne asada fries. Thats when she started talking crap and didn't realize i understood her. So everyone was laughing at us and then i ordered two tacos, one seso and one cabeza. The guy tells me just pay your order and ill get it to you. Both tacos smelled rancid and tasted old. I didn't touch it after that. \\n\\nWhats really terrible about this is that it all started by that this older lady at the burrito area named Veronica who had to throw away a warmed up tortilla and the fact that it only took a thrown warmed tortilla too intentionally try to give you food poisoning. \\n\\nThis experience is at the Tropicana location. Well were never coming here again. Unfortunately, we wont even try the other location."}

After seeing such rave reviews we were happy to find this place. After eating here I'm suspicious that the reviewers who gave this place 5 stars may have some affiliation with the owners or staff. When we walked in, there were a few occupied tables and everyone working there greeted us and one guy suggested we sit on the patio. We did and it was nice out there but then it took quite a long time for anyone to come out. When someone finally did he said he was going to get our drink order and then get us some menus. Weird order of events in my opinion. We had to wait until we got our drinks to even start deciding what we wanted to eat? The Hub's ordered an iced tea and I ordered a margarita with no salt. Our drinks and menus came out, mine with salt and when the Hub's asked for sweet n low the waitress said they didn't have any but offered sugar. Huh?! Ok, a little bizarre that they didn't have some sort of artificial sweetener but no big deal... until she returned with sugar on a paper plate. They apparently have iced tea but no sweeteners to offer with it. My margarita tasted like store bought mix and came out in a beer pint glass. Our food came out fast and it was ok until my husband got to the end of his French fries and there were curly black hairs in them. I have long blonde hair and my husband has auburn so they for sure weren't ours. I had to go in and give my credit card to the bartender to pay and when the waitress came back out with my receipt I showed her the hairs. She did offer to take the dish off of our ticket but I refused. He had eaten almost the whole thing so I didn't think that was fair. I heard her go in and summon the manager to show her the hairs but no one came back out to apologize so obviously they didn't care.

When I returned to pick up my watch the forth time, the owner informed me that they replaced the watch hands with generic parts. These watch hands look nothing like the originals. This was a $600.00 watch! Upon further inspection the watch hands were actually dirty on the green part that glows in the dark, and the back of the watch was put back on, upside down. After speaking with the owner at length he offered to \\\"take the watch hands out and give me the watch back\\\". He also noted that I \\\"did not pay a dime for the new watch hands\\\". He also admitted he had no way of getting the original parts. Don't you think you should tell your customer that?! I left the store and promptly filed a claim with my credit card company.

The first floor: all the McGill paraphernalia and regalia you'd never need and didn't even imagine existed. Stupid over-priced t-shirts and other assorted crap that they try to get parents to buy for their kids.  All that's missing is McGill toilet paper (now THAT I'd actually buy). So no books on the first floor (although they used to have magazines there). The second floor has a computer store and a coffee shop with the remaining third of the floor devoted to real, actual books: fiction, philosophy, sociology, etc. But the funny thing is that several years ago they actually stopped stocking books so now they disguise the empty bookshelves by placing the books covers facing out on the shelves. If you actually place the books the way they're supposed to lie on a shelf, they'd have about a quarter left. Finally, the third floor has some books but mostly uesless text and reference books.  So there you go.  \\n\\nWord on the street is that the evil head librarian at McGill brought in her inexperience husband to run the show at the book store some years ago and he's been running it into the ground ever since. It's the same corporate bottom line mentality that's rife through all of McGill. Logic: You don't make money selling books. You make money selling souvenirs. So why bother with the books?  Um, I don't know because maybe you're a university that's supposed to be a center for learning? So less books, more McGill crap, and a coffee shop that isn't even open in the summer anymore although tons of students, faculty and researchers are still around. The only reason I go is the twice a year clearance of books in which they get rid of more and more of their dwindling stock at cut rate prices.

She also returned a new punch card that still only had the single punch as the one I had given her, no second punch for the growler I was purchasing. I asked her about the coupon and she replied \\\"It was old, we don't have those anymore\\\" The expiration date was clearly written on the coupon in sharpie marker and it was well before that expiration date. I explained this to the bartender and asked her if they really do not accept their own valid coupons that are not yet expired to which she replied \\\"nope\\\". I was and am still appalled that a place of business would not honor their own coupons!! I was at a loss of words and didn't know how else I could try to help the bartender see how ridiculous this was. She was very rude and short with me  and showed no concern for trying to understand the situation. At which point I left and thought \\\"What the shit just happened? A business that doesn't accept their own coupons......\\\" They had the perfect opportunity to provide exemplary customer service and make everything right, I wish they would have at least tried."}

The first time I was 2 minutes late to order the sandwich, of course I waited in line for 15 minutes before having the opportunity to order.  The second time I waited for more than 10 minutes just to order their green tea, which turned out to be horrible.  The third time my husband and I made a morning trip so that I could order the breakfast sandwich.  What a waste of time and money.

It speaks to the disappointment I feel about there not being enough selection for film goers and movie buffs.

{"_id": 4, "text": "From check-in to check-out, Sanctuary Spa provides the ultimate spa experience. When it comes to my spa days, I like to choose wisely because I save my funds very carefully to treat myself to a spa experience. Because I save my pennies so carefully, I want an A+ experience at the spa I choose. Sanctuary gets an A+. \\n\\nI am going to be very detailed in my review, because when I'm looking for a spa I want to know every little thing about the spa. You will notice that the Sanctuary does an excellent job with the little extras that make a spa experience that much better. \\n\\nSetting:\\n\\nThe Sanctuary Spa is nestled on the base of Camelback Mountain. You enter through a plush neighborhood of beautiful houses and walk past state of the art tennis courts before entering the spa. I would call this spa intimate and state of the art. Yes, I've been to bigger spas, but bigger isn't always better. I opened the doors of the spa and entered a small check-in table where the staff greeted me with smiles and charm. They had me give them my CC upon arrival so that I wouldn't have to stop by and pay on my way out if I was in spa-mode. After check-in, they led me through double doors where two more spa attendants waited to give me a tour of the locker room and key to my own locker room. \\n\\nLadies Locker Room \\n\\nThe ladies locker room has everything I look for in a spa. It has a vanity area with lotions, hair spray, shaving gels, and several other products to use while getting ready. The bathrooms are spacious and offer mouth wash and disposable tooth brushes and toothpaste for use throughout the day. The private walk-in showers are also spacious and provide shampoo, conditioner, body wash and razors. The individual lockers offer a robe, flip flops and a towel. The jacuzzi is pretty small but on the quiet day I visited, it was just the right size. The waiting room for services is intimate but again, just the right size. They have hot tea, ice cold water, almonds and dried cranberries for guests to enjoy throughout the day. The ladies locker room provides the perfect setting for a relaxing day. \\n\\nThe Gym \\n\\nWhen I do spa days, I like to take full advantage of every amenity they offer. After all, I am paying a pretty penny so I want to get my money's worth! I tend to visit the gym first because then I feel even better going into my spa day. This gym is definitely a nice one. They offer complimentary water and Gatorade at the gym. The treadmills overlook a lap pool through large floor to ceiling windows so it's easy to day dream while you workout. The treadmills have TVS and complimentary disposable head phones just in case you forgot yours. They also have ellipticals, weights, bikes and offer a variety of fitness classes throughout the day. \\n\\nThe Pools \\n\\nI would say the spa lap pool is the only downfall (in my opinion) at the Sanctuary. During my spa days, I like to enjoy a tranquil pool that's not \\\"in the scene.\\\" I like to saunter out there before and after treatments, lay out and relax. The Sanctuary spa does offer access to their two pools, but one is a lap pool without much \\\"spa\\\" ambiance to it. It's more just like a workout pool with some lounge chairs. The other pool is the stunning negative edge infinity pool in the main hotel area. The pool itself can't be beat and sits against a backdrop of the desert and palm trees. It was beautiful, but it was also in the middle of the action, so it made my spa day a little more rambunctious than I was hoping for. However, the pool itself was beautiful and I've definitely seen wilder pools. Just be prepared to be in the scene if you go. \\n\\nThe Services \\n\\nNow let's talk services. I will say that my two technicians might be my favorite of all my spa experiences in the Valley: Sherry especially. Sherry gave me my Sanctuary Jewel facial which is a 50 minute facial that's customized to your skin. From the moment I met Sherry, she was so incredibly nice and made me feel at ease. She's Southern and her Southern friendliness definitely was in full force! Now, getting a facial can be nerve-racking because you are letting someone examine every flaw on your face. It's important that your technician makes you feel comfortable during the facial. Not only did Sherry make me feel comfortable, but she found traits to compliment me on throughout the facial and did it in a truly genuine manner. Not only was she nice, she gave me an amazing facial! I left with my skin glowing and my confidence still intact! For that I will continue to visit Sherry for facials. \\n\\nI had my massage done by Tara who did such a good job, I nearly fell asleep! Now be prepared for them to try to upsell you on products before the massage. That was the only downfall, but it's not the massage therapists fault for doing what they are told to do! I didn't add any extras, but the regular Swedish massage was all I needed!"}

{"_id": 4, "text": "To describe this briefly, it's like what you'd get if Viva Las Arepas actually tasted good.\\n\\nI was excited to try Rika Arepa Express when Amanda M. told me how good they were, and I my eyes grew wide when I heard that they'd be at Bad Beat Brewing in Henderson, which is just minutes from my place. They were supposed to be there at 5:30pm, and I arrived around 5:40, but the food truck took until 6:00 to arrive and spent perhaps 20 more minutes to set up their spot in front of Bad Beat and to get their stoves fired up and what not.\\n\\nMy wait was rewarded the moment I bit into my #1 Pabellon. The sweet plantains hit first with their warmth, their soft yet not mushy texture, and of course their sweetness. They made me regret not getting the combo, which comes with lots of sweet plantains. The shredded beef came next and delighted my taste buds with savory flavor. The black beans actually tasted good too, and the melted mozzarella was great. Encompassing all of its fillings, the arepa itself was a cornmeal flatbread with a crisp, browned exterior and a soft interior, and it easily stayed intact until the end. I love corn, by the way. The arepa and the foil wrapping turned out to be so hot that I'm pretty sure my fingers received first-degree burns, and my mouth didn't care one bit.\\n\\nSince I decided to sit truck-side, they offered me squeeze bottles of green creamy cilantro and  spicy (read: medium-ish) smoky red sauce. The pabellon arepa was possibly good enough without these sauces, but just a squeeze or two of each (or both at once) every couple of bites really enhances the flavor profile.\\n\\nOne arepa is huge enough (and, at $7 post-tax, is a good value), but I also ordered the #2 La Sure\\u00f1a with grilled chicken, smoked sausage, and avocado. It was almost as good as my Pabellon. The juicy flavor of the marinated/herbed chicken, the sweetness of the sausage, and the creaminess of the avocado all blended harmoniously with the hot and structurally sound arepa (serious props, this was over half an hour into the meal) to please my taste buds just minutes after I'd already enjoyed a masterpiece. I'd recommend trying both, although maybe you could consider sharing them with a friend (bring a knife or something).\\n\\nI also had the parchita, or passion fruit juice ($2). It's pretty much the same thing the Peruvian maracuya or any other juice made from real passion fruit that's had the seeds strained. It's sweet and has its own unique, almost incomparable flavor. It tastes like passion fruit. Yeah, that's the best description I can give, sue me. I enjoyed the parchita so thoroughly while waiting for my arepas and during the meal that I had to get a refill to-go ($1, in the original cup). The refill - most of it, anyway - is sitting in my fridge now and waiting for my taste buds to give in.\\n\\nAmanda M. and my other fellow Yelpers have it right. These guys are absolutely amazing. I think they're easily a contender for best food truck in Vegas, and they easily top Viva Las Arepas in the not-very-saturated arepas category. Make it a mission to find these guys at least once and I have no doubt that you'll be happy with your food."}

I was full and was too busy watching a basketball game after I claimed my free beer upon check-in that I didn't realize my friend had the burger split so we can share fries and a burger.  He asked for truffle mayo to dip the fries in and it was great.  The best part of the evening was the food came out in no more than 10 minutes!

The staff are perky and patient while you figure out the menu for the first time, and they don't go nuts over trying to turn tables if there isn't a crowd. This is counter service -- order up front, pick up the food in the back when called -- so it's pretty low key.\\n\\nThe breakfast tacos are pleasant, more than life-changing. If you have a serious problem with fairly well-done scrambled eggs, ask up front to have them runnier or order something else, as these are quite well-done eggs. In the future, I would stick to variations where there's something greasy like chorizo to counter the stiffness of the eggs. These tacos are very generous -- I thought I was starving and couldn't finish a plate of two with the accompanying Latin potatoes (which are very nice) and refried beans (which are generic).\\n\\nAs far as Mexican restaurants of this sort -- silly name, self-conciously funky decor, waitresses in tight shirts, very large drinks, loud music, okay food -- go, this is a bargain with a nice view of the neighborhood."}

I wear them everywhere. This winter, when the stitching began to rot, I even painstakingly sewed them back up, myself. But re-heeling is beyond my ken.\\n\\nI'm a tall lass of 5'11\\\", and naturally contrary and therefore inclined to wear heels, so a good place for shoe repair is essential in my neighbourhood. This branch of Timpson fits the bill, thank you. I took in three pairs of boots for re-heeling, including the beloved Boots of Bro and a pair with perished soles that needed a complete new sole. When I handed them over, I mentioned my mending job and the man actually took the time to examine and admire my work, which was really sweet of him. I was quoted upfront for the three pairs: just shy of \\u00a39 for each of the two pairs that just needed re-heeling, and \\u00a318.95 for the pair that needed re-soling, with re-heeling included in that. I thought that was pretty reasonable since a whole new sole on leather cowgirl boots can't be a small job. I was even asked whether I'd like to pay there and then or on collection - really nice to have the choice.\\n\\nBut when I returned, I was in for a surprise. \\\"One of your pairs, the whole heel was falling off,\\\" the man told me. I felt my stomach sink. \\\"We replaced it; there's no point just re-heeling if it's falling off anyway.\\\" Gosh, what a job. That can't have been cheap... But no! I was still charged only the price I was initially quoted! Amazing!\\n\\nThis funny little branch is more like a kiosk, just a counter in a wall in the shopping centre. The staff are cheerful and friendly and really seem to care; this gentleman was able, for example, to recognise me and tell me about my boots' heel without referring to any notes. And they got the whole lot done in less than 24 hours. I am happy and impressed, and all my lovely boots are good as new."}

First Sandra, she answered all of my many questions. Then I had her talk and answer my wife's (who was in Pa.) questions over the phone. Yes, the price was higher than I wanted to pay for patio furniture, but with the Arizona weather I didn't want to be buying furniture every two or three years.\\nThey are so confident about their products that all their furniture is displayed outside to show their customers how well it keeps in the Arizona weather. So after an hour or so of discussion and looking at all the selections, I decided on the furniture. But since my stairwells in my house are narrow, Sandra suggested I measure the width before I finalize the purchase.\\nReturning later that day with the measurements, I met Javier. Javier said if my measurements are correct, the couch and chair will not fit through the stairwells (the furniture is for our bedroom balcony which is on the fourth level of our home). To make sure of the measurements, Javier and I jumped in his car and went to my place so he could be sure that my numbers were correct. Unfortunately, my measurements were correct.\\nSo the deal is off????? Wrong!! Javier comes up with the idea of renting a crane to place the frame of the couch and the chair on the roof of my building. Then he and his workers would lower the furniture down from the roof to the balcony. After imagining all the things that could wrong, I agreed to the plan.\\nWell it worked to perfection!!!!!! No incidents or damage to property or bodies. The furniture looks absolutely fantastic on our balcony!!!!!\\nSandra and Javier were excellent in handling everything that was needed to satisfy my purchase and delivery. You can't ask for better Unique Patio Creations. Thanks Guys!!!!!"}

We held our birthday extravaganza in the front \\\"cottage\\\" area, which is the perfect spot for about 25-30 guests for a sit down dinner or a happy hour (done that one too). The pub also has a banquet room and separate bar out back which can be rented out for private functions. Another one of my friends held her wedding reception here and, in addition to having the great food and service you'd hope for at your wedding, it was just plain fun. \\n\\nBack to our Sunday birthday brunch... The kitchen prepared an Irish breakfast as well as a course of passed hor d'oeuvres of cucumber sandwiches, filet mignon brioche (my favorite) and salmon mousse toasts. For dessert I was able to bring in special cake for the party and the kitchen added an accompaniment of fresh strawberries and creme (brilliant). Everything came out well timed and executed start to finish. \\n\\nLucky for us, Sunday afternoons now offer live jazz - which was a great bonus for the party atmosphere.

Even their California Rolls are deelish. (I only know this from eating off of my friends' plates). Some of the best dishes they have aren't sushi at all. The Tuna Salad is bomb.com. Tuna Sashimi on a bed of greens and an awesome sweet/spicy dressing. I am sure the menu describes it better, but just eat it and be amazed. I recently tried the Lobster Spring Rolls. The roll is crispy and flaky and the lobster is always perfectly prepared. It comes atop what I think is a mango puree AKA mango baby food, but the mix of the lobster, cream cheese and super sweet puree makes for a party on the tongue. A couple tips, Fashion Show Mall employees receive a discount (I think 10% off total not including alcohol) and if you check in on Foursquare and tell your server, you get a free order of edamame or a bowl of miso soup. I also like that the entire staff is aware of their Foursquare specials and don't act jerky when you ask for free things."}

You would pass them buy if you looked only at the store fronts. The interior decor was exactly what I would expect from a good donut shop...simple, a few random pictures, a Buddah statue,  bamboo plants, a advertising board for local business, and a few old tables and chairs. Don't ever judge a donut shop by their dirty tables...judge them by how many people are sitting at those tables! In the mornings, Friendly's has their regulars that will walk thru the door and the lady behind the counter already knows what to get them. On any given morning you'll see all the regular old timer HotRod builders  having donuts talking shop. And you get to check out their cool cars out front.\\n\\nNow on to the goods...The donuts were similar to another donut shop, I won't name drop...but it rhymes with Donalds Robots LOL! We always pick up a dozen or two of misc of donuts and just take a bite from each one...but our favorites are the maple bars. Its light and fluffy with a delicious glaze. The chocolate covered bars are also good. I'm not a big bear claw fan, but I loved it. It was a good combo of donut and the right amount of flavorful apple fillin...it was just right.. My wife loves the cinnamon roll, its pretty big fluffy donut with a nice taste of cinnamon and glaze.  My in-laws love the Bavarian cream and so does all the old timers who frequent the place. We just tried their maple covered buttermilk donuts and WOW...I think we found ourselves another favorite. We here the apple fritters are good but we haven't tried them yet.\\n\\nPick up your donuts in the AM (they are open 7 days a week from 4am-10pm), its fresh and you won't be disappointed. Plus you'll have a better selection. The donuts are also CHEAP...I recently picked up a dozen mixed and a dozen donut holes for under $10.00...not bad. And another tip: CASH ONLY! not to worry their are many ATM/ Banks on Boulder Hwy.\\n\\nFriendly's is right up there with the best of Las Vegas donut shops and it would hang with any of the LA donut shops.

The staff members are rude to eachother and loud so you can hear them even when they're back in the kitchen- really kills atmosphere. Sat at our table for 5-10 minutes before we were greeted (waitress did apologize for leaving us sitting there so long).  I liked the edamame, miso soup & tempura were pretty good, but the main course (beef teriyaki & sushi) were average at best which is not saying much for a sushi place. Restaraunt was dirty inside, thick layers of dust on almost anything you looked at- all light fixtures, booths, walls, wood trim... makes you wonder how clean the kitchen is if they don't clean the places you _do_ actually see. Highlight was our waitress, very knowledgeable about the menu, and very sweet & genuine, if not for her, this probably would've been a 1 star."}

My favorite is the spicy pork, which has slightly sweet notes as you start eating, but the heat builds and next thing you know you had two bowls of rice.  \\n\\nThe food was delicious and relatively authentic (compared to the \\\"Americanized\\\" or more trendy eateries).  We even took a kid from Korea (on a later visit) who said the food was like how his mom makes.  Seriously.  But on a recent visit (maybe two or three weeks ago) we noticed that some of the menu items tasted differently.  Maybe a new cook?  Maybe they just changed the recipes?  It wasn't bad, but a surprise.  \\n\\nThe place is very unassuming, and I'm not sure if they even have a sign (in English...if you're going West to East on Spring Mtn., I know there is a sign in English).

It would have been better if it was hot. The truffled kabocha pumpkin gnocci was the only dish that impressed me. Again, not hot enough. For the entree, I expected to see lobster or crab as one of the options, after all it was New Years Eve in Vegas! Not so, I ended up eating chicken coq au vin, which was moist but I wanted something more gourmet than chicken. Beef was an option but I don't eat it. The dessert would have been good but it contained peanut butter, which I despise. A lot of people have peanut allergies, so I can't believe this was the only option they had. And they never even announced that it had peanut butter, they should have noted it on the menu. My gf did the wine pairing, she did not like most of the wines.

Our check-in process was smooth except that we found out our rooms were hundreds of numbers apart, so we went back in line to ask for a closer distance, and the CSR replaced another room right next to each other - so why didn't he just do that the first place? Obviously that room wasn't taken. Than we bumped into a huge disappointment after we entered our rooms - bulky TV, no fridge, no blow dryer.

Roy's is certainly not a new concept.. and there has been one here in Las Vegas for some time now, I just had never visited it. It's Hawaiian-Fusion, which doesn't apeal to me.. but I was with a group of buddies that wanted to go - so we went, and it was a special occasion. \\n\\nSo -  there were 6 of us.. and we were literally the first group through the door due to a 5:30 reservation.. none of us like to eat that early usually.. but we had places to be later. That being said, they weren't even done with their pre-shift meeting when we walked in, which was absolutely no problem.. we only waited about 2 minutes.\\n\\nHere's where it get a bit screwy. The hostess acknowledged that we were there for a special occasion, a bachelor party of sorts... very nice ... then she proceeded to sit us at a 6 top that had 2 of it's chairs in the main aisle. That was strange, since there were not any other tables sat anywhere else in the restaurant...and thus,  so many open ones. I waited to see if perhaps they had reservations for the other tables, but that did not happen and we did not complain. \\n\\nThe table was set for us, with a ribbon around the candle.. ok.. thank you for that... i think. They were trying to be nice.  Once guy picked out a bottle of white wine, about $50 bucks.. and I think he got a bit of a scoff when the server saw what he picked. Weird, still not too offended.. big night of spending ahead.. being frugal. the wine comes nearly 10 minutes later, and it's fine. Some Rosemont Chardonnay... way over-priced, but it's a restaurant wine list... you get that. \\n\\nAnother 5 minutes goes by, and the waiter returned and told us about specials.. he mentioned 4 different things from four different parts of the menu, and each one was the most expensive item in each category. OK. So I don't appreciate that.. but no big deal. We ordered a couple of his recommendations anyway. \\n\\nThen the 4 starters we ordered came on a large plate.. cool.. fusion style sushi rolls and they were good. We ate them and drank and chatted.. cool. Now it's time for entrees. They clear the table and set us up for the next course. 15 minutes go by. \\n\\n2 entrees for 2 of the guys arrive.... 2 or 3 minutes literally went by, and 2 more came .. One runner was running the food for our whole table and no one was helping him. So he made multiple trips. 2 or 3 minutes later.. 2 more entrees arrived. Each time, he would zip through a description of the food, and was a little unintelligible with most of his rehearsed speel.. but it was semi-self explanatory so no big deal. 2 more minutes.. 2 more entrees.. Finally,  all the food is on the table and we eat. \\n\\nI'm not super impressed with the portions, though the seafood I had was fresh. I ordered the seafood pairing or plate, or something to that effect. 3 shrimp on a skewer and two U10 scallops pan seared. The scallops were rare, not med-rare as stated they would be prepared.. which is strange because they were seared on a hot flat-top per  the description... maybe too hot though. The shrimp was well, well done.. a bit rubbery. .  Edible enough, not ''WOW' good.. but 'OK' good. Everyone seemed happy enough with the food selections. \\n\\nWe had pre-ordered the pineapple upside down cake and chocolate souffle per the waiters suggestion, because they have a longer preparation time.  After dinner was cleared and we were reset with sharing plates.. we were ready for dessert. \\n\\n10 minutes go by. \\n\\n2 chocolate souffles arrived. We looked at each other, and I thought that maybe they had sent an additional because of the occasion.. turns out this was the case. 2 or 3 minutes go by and the Pineapple cake arrives. Seeing a theme? ... slow pace.\\n\\nAll in all.. our waiter was cool, food was ok. We spent about $65 per person for about 3 courses and a bottle of wine... fresh seafood.. service in general.. nothing to want to rush back for. We were outta there at 7:45. Long meal for nothing in particular that was special. I don't know that I'll be back there soon. I would however, try it in another city. Good luck"}
{"_id": 3, "text": "This place has awesome deals of two for $5 fro-yo or boba!!!  I always get the same, taro milk tea w/ pearls.  They give you a stamp card for everything too!!!  So, every time you buy waffles, crepes, fro-yo, or boba, you get stamped!  They each have their own stamp cards though.  I think its pretty cool how they double stamp you even if you get the two for $5.\\n\\nI havent had their crepes, but the waffles are delish.  Only downside is that it does take a little while to come out, so if you're in a hurry i'd skip on the savory waffles, and grab something else.  Shaved ice is yum.  I always get the regular one with fro-yo, three toppings of your choice,  shaved ice, and condensed milk. \\n\\nI really enjoy coming here and everything i've tried so far is good.  Check it out if you're in the area."}

Went there during lunch hour and as we are getting ready to prepare our bowl. one of the members of their staff yells at me with an attitude \\\" you cant be back here\\\" what she is talking about the area between the 2 self serve veggie/ meat station. One bar was closed but with all the respect it is hard to reach to an item that is way in the back so I went to the other side to make it easier to reach and this girl yells at me from across instead of coming closer to me and warning me it is not allowed to be on the other side. How rude! what is ur location's goal here? go big or go home! I wont be visiting again."}
{"_id": 4, "text": "The BF and I were checking out the new Cosmopolitan when we noticed Jaleo. We are from LA and absolutely love Jose's The Bazaar, so how could we say no? \\n\\nThe place was packed when we got there at 9:30 p.m. on Monday. They are only open for dinner and service begins at 5:00 p.m. We were lucky enough to sit at the foosball table, which the hostess told us was Jose's table! (Although this is unverified.) I have to warn that you become subject to a lot of attention when you sit at the foosball table, because people were looking at us all night! One guy even wanted to take a picture.\\n\\nThe food was nothing short of what you would expect from Jose. It is so creative, inventive, and delicious! My favorites were the vegetable paella with sea urchin (which was on the house; the waitress said that the chefs were making it for everyone in the restaurant to share!), the fried egg with bread crisps and black truffle, and the piquillo pepper stuffed with crabmeat. The housemade sangria ($15 for half a pitcher) was really light and refreshing.\\n\\nI didn't have any problems with service; our waitress was really down-to-earth and lovely. I think one of the best services I've had. Even though it just opened, it seemed to flow seamlessly (for us at least). The food came out within reasonable times and they gave us their full attention. I'm definitely coming back next time I'm in Vegas. The paella is a MUST!"}

{"_id": 3, "text": "First I'd like to say that I love reading the reviews where dudes say \\\"there just aren't enough options for free weights for me\\\" or \\\"can't do heavy lifting here\\\". Lol. I challenge them to use the maximum weight of any dumbbells or machines in this gym. If you need more than 75 lb dumbbells, you. are. buffffffffff. and you should probably just start bench pressing cars or something in order to get a good workout.\\n\\nOk, so I went with this gym because of the price...$29 to start, $10/mo then up to $15/mo after a year. No contract, just $25 to cxl. I have since seen lots of Groupons and deals for it and that kiiiiiiiiiiind of pisses me off every time I see it. The prices are SIGNIFICANTLY lower on those sites and I wish I would've been able to take advantage of that when I joined. You can also do the higher level membership for something like $20/mo and get guest privileges and half price on products like drinks that you can buy. For me...I'd rather bring my own water anyway and since I don't bring anyone with me I don't need the guest privileges. But...it's an option.\\n\\nI like the cardio equipment, treadmills and arc trainers (kiiiiiind of like an elliptical but with more of a stair climber motion than elliptical has). They all have TVs built in with basic cable to distract you from your boring cardio. Haha. They also have iPod capability where you plug in using their plug (which charges your iPod while you use it) and you can listen to it through the machine using the buttons on the machine to skip, play, control volume, etc...\\n\\nBecause the equipment is new, I haven't experienced many broken machines like I have at older gyms. I have reported equipment that was malfunctioning in various ways and the employees are always prompt about testing them, putting \\\"out of order\\\" signs on them, and I have never seen something broken for more than a day or two.\\n\\nThey do have some equipment like medicine balls, kettle weights, and the big inflatable exercise balls. I don't personally use these things, but they ARE available and some people dig them.\\n\\nThere are no classes or pool, which I never used at other gyms anyway so I'm glad not to have to pay to not use them.\\n\\nThe employees are...cool for the most part. Most of them are friendly and willing to help you figure out a machine or exercise, spot you, or answer questions about workouts. There are a few rude ones, but I won't be too specific about those for fear that they will read this. Hey, I have to keep going here! :P \\n\\nThe gym is constantly being cleaned by the employees...vacuuming, wiping things down with spray, and checking and lubing up cables are things that seem to constantly be going on here. I like this a lot. There are also cleaning stations where you can grab your own spray and paper towels to wipe things down if  you wish. They offer hand sanitizer as well, which is nice at a place like a gym where everyone is touching everything.\\n\\nAs I read as a complaint in another post, they DO ask that you bring a towel. I too think this is a little annoying because I'm not one of those people who sweat all over the damn place, BUT...I get why it's a policy. There are some sweaty ass people at the gym and there's nothing worse than getting on a treadmill with nasty sweat droplets all over it or trying to sit on a weight bench that has someone's ass crack sweat on it. Gross. Just bring the towel people. There's no rule about the towel...it can be a little 2x2 square if you want to be a smart ass, or a beach towel if you like to maybe wear a towel cape while working out.\\n\\nI've heard of a couple people getting double charged for their memberships, but staff is pretty quick to resolve these issues.\\n\\nOverall, this is a good gym. It certainly offers enough for anyone to get a decent workout. I guess if you're a professional body builder who needs 1,000 lb machines and 200 lb dumbbells, it's not good enough, but for NORMAL people it's sufficient."}

This is a great place to go for delicious affordable food and nice atmosphere at any time of the day. -- They're open 24/7! \\n\\nThe burgers are absolutely delicious and are HUGE! I always cut them in half and end up eating the second half later on. They also have yummy pasta dishes and soup and sandwich combos. My favorite thing that i ordered was the spicy crispy chicken burger; just the right amount of spice with all the right toppings and served with their tasty french fries! \\n\\nI definitely recommend checking this restaurant out whether you're looking for a place for lunch after shopping and walking the strip or a place for dinner before a night on the town!"}

So  when we find out a reverse happy hour, we have to go try it!\\n\\nWe walked in to Pan Asia at the start of reverse happy hour and we were greeted like they have never seen people in their lives. The hostess proceeded to tell us that they haven't seen anyone in a few hours. \\n\\nAs we had pick of the restaurant we picked the best booth and sat back to enjoy some Sushi and Chinese food. \\n\\nWe ordered a few rolls, the Spicy Tuna was disappointing and nothing to rave about. The Lasagna roll was creamy and cheesy and very yummy! The Grand Canyon roll was one of the best rolls I have had in a while.\\n\\nWe also ordered a noodle dish, Pan Asia Pan Fried Noodle, crunchy noodles with lots of good veggies and seafood. Very tasty.\\n\\nThe service was as good as can be expected for a young boy server, although I had to wait a while for a refill, which is extremely annoying when you have a restaurant to yourselves!\\n\\nI just worry that the prices, which unless on Happy Hour or Reverse, seem a little high. $14 for a sushi roll, no matter how good, is just too expensive. And the fact that they don't have a ton of customers...maybe just a slow night? I hope this place makes it. The owners obviously put a lot of money into it!"}

{"_id": 2, "text": "Montreal is a great foodie town, and it has its staples.  French/Quebecois cuisine.  Bagels.  Destination restaurants like Joe Beef.  'Montreal smoked meat' is definitely on that list, though maybe not the first one that an out-of-towner like myself thinks of.  Once you get past that part and hear that this is a must-have, chances are Schwartz's will be the main place you hear about.\\n\\nSchwartz's and the locals know that this place is popular.  The day before we visited while buying bagels at St-Viateur (another name you'll surely hear being held in high regard), the other patrons were raving about the length of the \\\"lineups\\\" in front of Schwartz's.  Schwartz's also realizes this, and in turn operates both a sit-down and carry-out side of their business, a major plus for moving the crowds through quickly.\\n\\nThe beef itself...pretty good.  If you're familiar with the corned beef, this has similar consistency, utilizing the same brine-curing process, but is actually kosher-style beef brisket.  Throw a bit of mustard on that and put it between 2 slices of bread, and that's all you need!  The amount of hype may have knocked it down a star, but if you go, you won't be disappointed.  Just remember to grab napkins on your way out...this is by no means the tidiest sandwich you'll ever eat."}

{"_id": 1, "text": "The problem with Las Vegas culture is that the level of service or friendliness you receive is probably based on one's perception of your \\\"high roller\\\"-ness. Unless you look like the type that sweats dollars out of your pores, you can probably expect a level of mediocre service in Vegas on par with the waiters at a Chinatown dive where you have to ask the waiter for water 5 times before you even get it. \\n\\nYou don't pay $60+ an entree at a steakhouse on the mere fact that it tastes good (at least no self respecting person should). When you're eating at a fine steakhouse you're paying a premium for the experience and service as well. While this place appeared destined for success like we had an '11' at the blackjack table... we ended up hitting and drawing a 5. The service was horrible.\\n\\nIn addition, the girlfriend and I both ordered the kobe beef filets. But how on earth did two identical menu items come out tasting so different. Mine tasted exactly how I liked it, savory, tender, with a touch of smokiness.

You have the guys that look like steroid users and then the girls that look like they work at Deja Vu, I don't mean to stereotype but how else are you going to get the picture? I personally don't care, yea, they look good and I need a LOT of work, but seriously, we're all there for the same reason, it's just going to take more time for myself lol oh well! \\n\\nThe gym and locker rooms are well maintained, the machines don't smell like butt and most times, if a machine needs attention, the people that work out here are pretty good about letting management know. My only gripe is that they need to MOVE THE FOOD STAND ELSE WHERE. Right when you walk in, you smell food, and it smells pretty good. I'm coming here to work off the crap I just ate and now they're tempting me with more crap to eat! Boo! \\n\\nThere are a variety of amenities that you're able to take advantage of, of course, certain thing may cost a little more but prices are still pretty good compared to other gyms. They have racket ball courts, indoor track, women's workout room, steam room, indoor pool, spin classes, zumba classes, really, a lot of classes. Their classes are pretty cool, you're able to join in any of the classes no matter what level you are, you don't have to wait for an 'advanced' or 'beginners' class, you go in and you go at your own pace. \\n\\nAnother amenity that's available for parents of young children is that they have a play room where they can watch your kids. I've seen infants in there and I think that the oldest age that you can take there is 12. Monitors are inside the gym, so you're able to check in on them without having to walk all the way over there. \\n\\nAfter the gym, I like the fact that there's a Tropical Smoothie right across the street and they offer a 10% discount to LVAC members. \\n\\nI like this gym, just move the food some where else, PLEASE."}
{"_id": 3, "text": "Okay...anyone who frequents Las Vegas knows that many of the very best chefs in the world have restaurants there. It is literally a city oozing with 5 star sauces. The problem is, many of the restaurants are jammed into smoky casinos, overpriced, and often focus on the show more than the food.  Sure...go to Switch once and watch in awe as the walls change and the roof rotates before your eyes.  It will be entertaining, and take your mind off the fact that you are about to get a $400 bill.  Everyone should experience it at least once. No pain no gain.\\n\\nFor those of you who consider a night \\\"off the strip\\\" somewhat of a victory however, I strongly  recommend that you give The Barrymore a try.  It does not have flashy dancers, crazy lasers, moving walls, ice sculptures, or celebrity chefs.  What it does have however, is old Vegas charm and...oh yeah...excellent food.  \\n\\nThe ambiance is more Lionel Barrymore than Drew Barrymore in almost every respect.  The dining room is warm and cozy with plush booths and a classy 40's-style movie motif.  One truly feels as if they might just look in the booth next to them and catch a glimpse of Bogey or Grant sipping on a cosmopolitan with a lady friend.  \\n\\nThe staff is great as well.  From the time we walked in and sat down, we received flawless service.  Our head waiter was dressed in a white dinner jacket and looked as if he could have just finished serving Lionel himself.  He was fully familiar with the dinner menu, bar specialties, and did not hesitate to offer his opinion on wine choices.   The evening manager also stopped by our table, introduced himself, and asked about our experience. \\n\\nWe dined on NY Strip steak, braised short ribs, and a wonderful risotto. Each dish was well executed, top quality, and very enjoyable. The highlight was a wonderful roasted artichoke, which still haunts my taste buds two weeks later. \\n\\nSo, if you are in Vegas looking for a flashy trendy restaurant named after some celebrity on the Food Network, you may be happier on the strip eating a $35 shrimp cocktail with the din of slot machines in the background.  If however, you are looking for a classy, elegant, dining experience with a real \\\"old Vegas\\\" feel.  Give The Barrymore a try.  The difference is black and white!"}

We asked for an EMPTY table in the corner that was BETWEEN 2 tables that had patrons at (would assume the waitress that was serving those tables could serve the EMPTY table) but were told we would have to wait 5 minutes before they could assing a waitress to our table.  We asked if we could wait while sitting at the EMPTY table.  That bothered the hostess but she allowed us to sit there.  And...YES... we waited... longer than 5 minutes as waitresses passed up our table to wait on the tables around us.  After ordering, the coffee took forever to come--- in paper cups because they ran out of actual coffee cups...with a LESS than packed house....guess that means if they are full at breakfast time...EXPECT TO GET YOUR COFFEE IN PAPER CUPS.

(1 hour body & 1/2 hour foot massage) We arrive at 8:32 and start filling out forms.  My wife's 1st question SPECIFICALLY asks for a strong therapist.  The receptionist says yes, there is a strong therapist.  My wife's 2nd question was if the therapist was Thai; the receptionist says no, they are Chinese...BUT they've been trained by a Thai therapist.  I have nothing against Chinese therapists (I am Chinese) when I am getting a Chinese massage.  The techniques are worlds apart.  The receptionist continues to say it's OK, many customers ask for these therapists, they are good, etc...\\n\\nSo we make the wrong choice and continue.\\n\\nWe change into their shirt and pants and lie down on the mat.  My massage starts with a foot rub and pressing on my legs.  Not much of a massage just kind of squeezing on my muscles.  Continued onto the rest of my legs.  After that she started to pull and bend my legs.  Not much pressure was being applied so I'm not sure what this \\\"exercise\\\" was about.  Not much changed for the duration of the 1 hour.  A lot of of just lightly rubbing and petting like other Yelpers mentioned.  Rubbed my scalp, my ears, my back, my neck and my arms a few times.  Pulled on my fingers...THIS WAS NOT A MASSAGE.\\nNow onto the last 1/2 hour, the foot massage.  The therapists actually switched at this point!  I didn't know what's going on until later.  Much of the same thing, squeezing my foot here and there and that's about it.\\n\\nMy wife is fuming about her massage while we're changing back to our clothes. \\n\\nFor her first hour, she had to tell the therapist where to massage and she needed to be stronger.  Nothing relaxing about this at all.  Kept telling her stronger, the therapist would press a little harder once or twice.  This one didn't have a clue of how or where to massage.  This went on for an hour.\\nSo the therapists decide that they need to switch because the one massaging my wife was getting tired from using all her strength...WT??  My therapist had more energy because she was just squeezing my arms & legs, they switch so I get the tired therapist to massage my feet.  \\nThe last 1/2 hour for my wife was exactly like mine, just a foot squeeze.\\n\\nSo we go to the front counter to tell the receptionist of what just happened.  She actually said to us, \\\"we came in too late in the day, all the therapists are tired.  It's time for them to go home.\\\"  If we knew this, we would not have even came here at all. I don't know why, but we paid and gave a tip...\\n\\nSo the next morning, I call and look for someone to talk to about my experience.  I called their other location and talked to a \\\"manager\\\".  She took my number and said she'll call the \\\"general manager\\\".\\nI get a call and talk to this man and he said sorry I can't help you, you stayed for the 1.5 hours so I can't do anything for you.  I explained that what we received was not a massage and I shouldn't have to pay for this.\\nHe said if the therapists used more strength, they can get in trouble if they hurt their customers.  I said they weren't even massaging their customers!  \\nThis man is very impolite and did not care about customer service at all.  He hung up on me.\\nOh yeah, he said we got a 20% new customer discount...we got a good price. Yeah right.\\n\\nPass on this place.

New layout is better, and I'm loving their furikake chicken even more than my old fav the off-menu katsu dip (chicken katsu dipped in korean chicken sauce). Even their mac salad seems better, although Island Sushi's potato mac salad is still my all time fav for plate lunch. \\n\\nThe owner of Island Sushi was working in the kitchen last week for some reason (no he didn't buy it) so maybe that's what the change is. Whatever the reason - I love this place again! Although I tried their new to me dessert - haupia ice cream pie. It wasn't very good - tasted like cheap coconut ice cream, smelled like suntan lotion.

It's worth the experience, even if you try this place at least once. \\n\\nThere are many great places to eat in Vegas, much better than even this buffet, so if you're not looking to gorge yourself, then maybe bust out that Yelp app. \\n\\nWhat makes this buffet stand out are the individual dishes here that I prefer over other buffets that may have a bit more selection. Duck confit ravioli, KBBQ ribs (though not the best), mac and cheese bar, tiny portioned out salads, fried chicken, charcuterie station, and those random little dishes that have a different twist of flavors that you won't find at other buffets make me enjoy the difference here. Many of their dishes are served in individual containers so it's interesting. \\n\\nI do feel there is a strong difference in quality, execution and variety of dishes you'll find here throughout the year. When I went in January, it wasn't memorable, and definitely not the place I've hyped up to some people. During Summer, it's so busy but you'll still find days in the week where the line won't be as long as the weekends and there are more food options. \\n\\nAs for dessert, they have better desserts elsewhere, but their Gelato is made in house and the flavors are unique. \\n\\nIf you're looking for many types of different cuisine and a wide assortment of dishes within that type of food or cuisine, you're better off going to Bacchanal."}

{"_id": 0, "text": "First off let me say that the management there was very helpful in trying to fix my issues with their service. And there is where the good ends. I had 3 bikes \\\"tuned up\\\" and serviced there. I live 5 miles from the shop and to pick them up as I could find a ride there, and ride them home. The first bike I picked up had a flat tire, and the back tire was on crooked. Amateur hour. After complaining to the manager, I found they had missed some some other things as well. The 2nd bike I picked up was fine, but then again, they really didn't need to do anything to it besides the \\\"tune up\\\", so not much praise can given there. I just went to pick up the 3rd bike today, and after riding 2 blocks towards home, the whole back wheel came off the drop outs. None of my gearing was shifting correctly either. I spent $200 (should have been $300, but was given a discount due to the first bike not being done correctly). I'm truly wondering what I paid for. I have been a long time customer of Cactus bikes, but after being convinced to try these guys out, and due to convenience of location, I gave them a shot. Big mistake. They did offer to let me drop the bike back off and let them try again, but I would rather spend another $50 somewhere else then let these guy's touch my bike again. The bike mechanic was very rude, and I witnessed him also being rude to another customer while picking up my 2nd bike. Again, the management was great, but they really need to take a look at who they having working in service, before they lose more customers. Thankfully I was on the sidewalk when the back tire fell off, and not in the bike lane, as this could have had a tragic result. If I can't count on my wheels being put back on correctly and aired up, I surely can't count on anything else being done properly when it comes to the service side. My advice - save your money and time and go somewhere else"}

{"_id": 0, "text": "The M Resort doesn't nearly deserve any of the praise and hype in my opinion.  Let's just talk about the buffet.  Overall the food is fair.  For $29.99 you can enjoy a 'seafood buffet' which means you get the leftovers from everything not eaten by yesterday's crowds with some additional crab legs, mahi-mahi and shrimp.  The crab legs are a little too fishy tasting as they sit in heaps next to a vat of melted butter which has particles of various foods floating in it.  Typically, people at buffets get in line for the crab legs, well, not at this place and now I know why.  Their crab is disgusting.  Some of the other buffet mentionables include marginal prime rib and tri-tip beef.  The desserts I would say are above average, particularly the coconut macaroons and cr\\u00e8me brule.  How this buffet got dubbed 'Best Buffet' in LV by Best of Las Vegas is a joke and somebody is definitely on the take.  \\nHowever, the average food gets overlooked by the poor service across the board.  From top to bottom, the cashiers, maitre de, servers, etc are all less than helpful.  After 45 minutes in line to enter the buffet, there was a guy in front of my party who brought a wedding party of 60 (all of whom were gambling, shopping or whatever rather than waiting in the line) to the front of the line as he approached the cashiers.  No they didn't have a reservation.  No they didn't pay together.  They each paid separately and this was a total inconvenience to the 150+ people who actually waited in line and it created about a 20 minute standstill log jam and the line didn't move while servers scrambled to create a table to fit a party of 60.  I think the M could have prevented this by having a line usher to police the line.  When I expressed my opinion of that its poor policy to have 1 person wait in line for a party of 60, without a reservation, without paying altogether, the Maitre De, just didn't seem interested to listen at all.  Utter shame.  \\nI thought I was going to a highly touted local casino with a touch of classy.  Well, I was mistaken.  For those of you looking to go to a classy locals casino, hit up the Green Valley Ranch Resorts.  Better atmosphere, gaming, food and they know how to treat people.   \\nI will never step foot in the M resort ever again and neither will my friends or family.   So guess how many stars I'm giving the M?"}

I mean, don't get me wrong, there were some items from Chang's that were legit and done very well, but there were more fails than wins. \\n\\nMy favorites:\\n- Shrimp har gow (shrimp dumplings) - this was amazing the first round, delicate and lightly sweet, but the second round was lacking a lot of flavor and not as tender. \\n- Cheong Fun (Rice Noodle Rolls) with Shrimp - lovely pillowy soft noodle texture, but 2 miniature shrimps in each roll.  \\n- Fried Shrimp Balls served with sweet mayo - this was our favorite, the shrimp balls were super moist inside and flavorful.\\n\\nI'll pass:\\n- Pork Sui Mai - This classic was shamefully bland and unmemorable.\\n- Steamed BBQ Pork Buns - they were on the mushy soggy end. The minimal BBQ pork filling wasn't bad, but it's also not the best either. \\n- Chicken Feet - good flavor, but fatty and I couldn't get past how oily it was.\\n- Fried Taro Puffs stuffed with pork - It had a nice pillowy taro texture, but it was extra soggy on the bottom from being soaked in oil.\\n\\nWe came here on a Sunday at about 3pm and even though they advertised that Dim Sum is served all day, we were having a difficult time ordering it. Only one lady came out with a cart when we sat down. After we grabbed a couple items from her cart, they all bounced and started their lunch - so no one served us for the rest of our meal. There were no carts to be seen. We wanted to order more, but no one came to check on us.\\n\\nWe finally got the manager to serve us since he was the only one not on his lunch break. He seemed a little agitated that we wanted to order more. Not to mention, they ran out of a couple items that we wanted to order.\\n\\nPro Tip: come during prime breakfast and brunch hours- any time after that the service and food will be nonexistent. \\n\\nThe restaurant didn't give off a clean vibe. The bathrooms are super sketchy, old, sticky, and scary. It makes me wonder what's the condition of the kitchen.\\n\\nAll of this made it a less than desirable dining experience.

But not in the mysterious case of Golden Spoon. \\n\\nThe first thing that made snack time less wonderful was the fact that the teenagers who worked there acted very impatient. I know that 17 year olds have a lot of really important shizz to do, but if I am going to spend so much on ice cream I'd like to think about it for a minute. They were pretty rushy about forcing us to order right away, so I ended up getting vanilla in a panic. I can't be a flavor adventurer if you are going to rush my decisions!\\n\\nI am not a big ice cream person, or froyo extraordinare, or whatever you would call yourself if you are a yogurt foodie. But I did not expect to be charged .95 cents per topping. What if I had wanted two toppings? Or seven? That could get even more costly very quickly. In fact, if that girl hadn't been rolling her eyes at me, I may have gotten seven toppings and ended up with a TEN DOLLAR FROYO! I like the idea of the topping bar better. We probably should have tried Yogurtland, but I was under the impression that these places were all the same. I guess I'm just a yogurt racist.\\n\\nThe vanilla I had was okay. The cake topping was a little weird and dry. My boyfriend had the peanut butter cup... the first bite was okay and the second bite had a weird after taste. I wasn't a fan at all. It really was like reeses flavored rice cake. Since we paid so much for it my boyfriend brought it home and put it in the freezer so he could pretend like he was going to finish it. Silver lining: I bet it hasn't lost any of its creepy flavoring in the freezer!\\n\\nThe yogurt wasn't very good, it was overpriced, the service left a lot to be desired and the atmosphere was average. Add that to the horrific parking situation outside and I just don't see any reason we will ever return to the Golden Spoon unless it is passing by on the way to Chipotle. It was so disappointing that it makes me want to stop trying new things."}

They had a lack of waiters, well no actually, there were enough staff serving, but they hadn't allocated not enough serving staff to our group.

It didn't help that the girl behind the counter (literally 12 inches away from me) was texting  and made me wait for a second to finish her thought before even acknowledging me!"}

I had two martini's, one dirty and one straight up, both were good.  The dirty could have been more dirty.  Husband got a mixed drink with the rum, still good. A little small, but I think the portions depend on what drink you order. Best just to ask the bartender and tell them what specifically you are looking for in a drink.  \\n\\nFood came out very quickly.  Ordered the Calamari, skip that one next time. The Maui Burger, great! It seemed as if it was made with a little bit of sausage, not a bad thing, a unique taste that was refreshing.  Spareribs, also good. Tender.  Catfish taco was the winner.  They only give you one, order more than one. Hands down though, best flavor of the night. Can't be beat for $2.  We ate for $9 total and drank for $21 dollars, we were done in about an hour. It was a good happy hour."}

While I LOVED OUR WEDDING and the hotel did manage to surprise us that day...the stress that the resort caused us before the wedding was not worth it. We started working with the hotel in May 2010 and through the entire process worked with 4 different people in catering....2 of which left the resort and one of which was so awful that we had to ask to work with her supervisor, Tracy Mead. The hotel had lots of turn over and was very unorganized. Planning a wedding is supposed to be a happy time but the Montelucia made the process AWFUL. Once Tracy took over (after 7 months of hell) things seemed to work out a little better. We still had issues with booking guest rooms and an issue with our contract which I do not even want to get into. \\n\\nOur wedding DAY was amazing and the staff on hand that day went the extra mile to make sure it was. I had a shadow the entire night and she was the best! Our bridal suite was beautiful as well. Tracy Mead did turn things around in the end but I still would not recommend getting married here. While the Montelucia is the most beautiful venue to get married at in Scottsdale in my opinion the internal issues we went through with the hotel were unnecessary and extremely stressful."}

We finished our DTLV night after Park on Fremont here with fellow yelpers plus meet up with more yelpers in toasting Noah R birthday. My first impression was wow its really nice and man think under dressed for it. It definitely more of upscale bar or without doubt out of the all the bars clustered together downtown this one by far most upscale and classy arts look too it. The artwork on the walls most of them huge paintings of have no idea or the cool chandeliers. It kind of dark got me thinking at the haunted mansion ride at Disneyland. The artwork feel like person staring right into your eyes so waiting for the eyes too move or something. Lol! Just the details too the interior is pretty darn cool!! The upstairs patio area sure something unique too downtown and on perfect weather day (that night it was) nothing better in life. The view looking down see the vibe going on that night, break out few dance moves with the music going on, and see El Cortez Hotel all the history of that Hotel too downtown. Patio for sure cool spot too chill out hanging out with friends drinking enjoying life. When the place is packed it totally like club because we walked around too check it out and push my way through get from one end too another. Almost missed they have this cool game or people playing so never figured it out. You throw some object attached too string at target and that about all I got. Sure next time I visit going too figure it out.\\n\\nThe prices it not that bad still pricey but cheaper then going too club or drinking on the strip for the most part?  This coming from someone like me going clubbing few and far between so take it for what it worth. Lol! I really like the vibe of the place and between the patio and inside lot of different places can hang out get your drink on at Commonwealth. Another great addition too awesome downtown scene of little bars, food spots, and lot of fun!"}

I called him when she returned home and asked him what kind of scam they are running and he said that they don't accept that coupon and the fact that their name and location is on the coupon is irrelevant.

{"_id": 3, "text": "This hotel is nice. Some rooms are amazing - the renovated rooms are lovely. The Casitas are not. Be warned - they are comfy but tired - broken lamp, leaky gas fireplace, ripped curtains, broken phone for 3 days. You get the idea. I am really torn between 3 and 4 stars. We were in a 3 star room, but there are a lot of 4 star rooms there, I know. It really is a nice hotel, but it just cannot have things like that and still be considered a luxury resort. Also be warned that the water slides are a lo-o-o-ng walk from the Casitas, and families (who want the water slides) seem to end up at the Casitas. The Casitas are really a trek from everything. Furthermore, inexplicably, there is a serious shortage of hot tubs. The Casitas have their own little pool with a teeny hot tub that is terrifying to use. I hurt myself walking into it both times as it lacks enough steps and has broken filters on the bottom. The pool you will want to use if with kids is the East pool and the Sonoran splash - a giant pool area with a fun double slide - and no hot tub anywhere. Every single family over there is asking about it and seems utterly flummoxed. So then you trek all the way back soaking wet and shivering to either the South pool (more of the adult crowd and they do not want your kids in there) to use their hot tub or back to the Casitas to use the teeny treacherous one there. Very bizarre for a big club. And the word on the street is true -they do nickel and dime you, so be warned. Little things will add up. They have a skating rink! Wheee! but you will spend 100 dollars to use it with your 3 children. And then they will have a stand for hot chocolate nearby and charge 5 dollars for water based hot chocolate and 9 dollars for a baggie with the makings for 2 'smores. Really? If you aren't even serving real hot chocolate don't you think you could just make it free for the people who are spending all that money to skate? Another thing to keep in mind is that the Princess is really out of the way. The zoo and the botanical garden are more than 30 minutes. But they are close to the Musical instrument Museum and that is a world class place- a must visit for anyone in the area!! There are plenty of restaurants nearby, so that is nice, but a lot of the activities are in other areas of the city. The Christmas decorations are really nice. The pools are pretty good. The food is pretty good. I am on the fence and just not sure if I should say 3 or 4 stars."}

{"_id": 0, "text": "First time in my history of steak dining I send my steak back! Where do I begin... Decided to eat here since I'm staying at the mirage. The front desk manager told us it was amazing so I figured its a must since I'm a huge steak house guy. From the get go I wasn't impressed with the small menu but I figured that its kept small to make sure what the serve is perfect. We started with the heirloom tomatoe salad and the baby green salad, not amazing but okay (portions very small also). Since we weren't really impressed with any of the other starters we decided to order extra sides with the steak. My brother got the NY strip and myself got the bone-in rib eye (mind you the bone was no where to be found). The NY strip was decent but not great, the rib eye unfortunately was actually pretty gross (it kills me to say). For starters meat was purple not red (I eat my steak mid rare) also a bit over seasoned with salt and pepper bit on top of it all it just had a weird undescribable taste. Pondered back and forth about my dilemma but figured for $59 I'm def not gonna pay for something so disappointing and something I had 3 bites of. When i called my waiter over you coupd tell he was a bit surprised i was sending it back but whatever. His service was mediocre at best, kimda pushy to get us to order drinks which i absolutely hate (we arent at fridays so chill) and over all he was unattentive. The rest of the wait crew i must say were on top of their game though. Sides were pretty decent, we got the finger potatoes, onion rings and roasted mushrooms (all good). Over def regret the dining decision, hopefully we make up for it with our next two dinners. If you can avoid this place, the restaurant Stack next door is 100 times better in my opinion. Always the worst when a restaurant plays off the name of their celebrity chef and assumes their mediocre food is top notch. I'm honestly baffled this place has a ton of 5- star reviews."}
{"_id": 2, "text": "I have delayed in posting this review so the descriptions may not be accurate. My visit was actually less than 24 hours and it was on 11/02/06. So here we go...\\n\\nWhen you arrive at the Aladdin, you wonder to yourself, am I staying at a Hotel/Resort/Casino or am I going into a garage? I kid you not, the valet/taxi/shuttle drop off is not on the Vegas Strip and it is not under a famed porte cochere. You literally drive into what looks like a parking lot entrance. I had to ask the driver, \\\"Is this really it?\\\" Once I entered the building I walked through what best could be described as the employee or loading dock entrance. Truly a first for me. At the end of the corridor was a bank of elevators that takes you up to the hotel registration. As I walked to the registration desk, I realized that the remodeling was not quite complete because there were signs all over to remind me of that. Even though I arrived before the stated check-in time, the agent was able to get me a non-smoking king room.\\n\\nThe room itself was quite nice. Actually BIG is a better way to describe it. The room had a desk, chair, armoire for TV, round table and 2 more chairs next to that, and of course the king size bed. And the best thing of it all is that there was even space around all this furniture to walk around in. The bathroom was equally large. It had a  separate bathtub and shower and vanity. I can safely say that 2 people could get ready and not get in each others way. Very convenient.\\n\\nAs for the casino floor, The last time I visited Vegas was back in 2001 and I used to be able to brag that I never got lost on the casino floor. This place literally put me in my place. I got lost finding the exit, I got lost finding the Starbucks, and I even got lost finding the promotion booth. In fact I did not even find the promotion booth so I could get a players card. However, once I calmly walked around the floor a couple of times, I realized that the casino floor is in the center of the building and is surrounded by the shopping mall. One other thing that I noticed that the shops seem to cater to the Hawaiian tourists. For they had TWO of the ABC Stores which are famous in Hawaii as the local convenience store.\\n\\nSo here's the bottom line. On my next trip to Sin City, I probably would not stay at the Aladdin again, but I would like to go and visit the shops and the Oyster Bar"}

{"_id": 4, "text": "CK's, why did it take so long for me to write a review on you?  Perhaps I have taken your awesomeness for granted.  \\n\\nI am always critical of neighborhood bars.  Read my reviews, I'm critical of everything.  Believe it or not, I've even been called an asshole.  The thing is, I really don't have anything bad to say about this place.  I hope the owner/manager reads this because the only way a local bar survives is with repeat business, and you sir and/or madam, have earned mine.  I will now use my college education to cite with examples:\\n\\nHere is one thing you are kicking ass and taking names at Dirty Harry style. (did I fire five chicken wings or six?  In all the confusion, I have kind of lost track myself)  Daily specials.  Not only are they awesome, they never change.  Nothing pisses me of more than expecting something, driving down, and it is different.  I have been coming in for quite a while on Tuesday nights with one of my friends.  We always order the same thing (by the way, 40 cent wings on Tuesday and HUGE beer for $2.50...bring that shit on) \\n\\nThat leads me to your servers.  Usually, we are lucky enough to have the same one, and she is frigging awesome.  Knows our regular order, walks up, takes the menu's away, jokes and says \\\"I know what your order is!\\\" and brings it.  (extra buck or two on the tip just for that) Even if we have another server, they are always polite, attentive, and friendly.  Not coming up every 5 minutes bothering me or being non-existent.  Seems like they wait until you are 75 percent done with your drink and THEN ask if you want more.  Perfect.  They attack with military precision few possess.  \\n\\nLongest I think I have probably ever waited for my wings was 10 minutes.  Maybe.\\n\\nHad a family birthday party here a few months ago on a weekend night and they made things VERY easy and everything was organized.\\n\\nStill on the subject of the servers, seems like there is virtually no turn over here and the wait staff seems like they actually enjoy their jobs, not like my job and unlike some other bars where the employees are bitchy and seem like they would rather stab you in the throat than take your order.  CK's does not possess the bitchiness and violent tendencies as previously described.\\n\\nOther good points condensed in cliff note form: \\n\\n-Bands 3 nights a week with no cover.  Awesome.  \\n-The video games actually work.  Nothing pisses me off more than cramming a few dollars into playing big buck hunter and the fucking gun is broken.  Or golden tee and the goddamn wheel is lopsided.  The \\\"claw machine\\\" actually has prizes you can win that are big enough for my dogs to at least have more than 5 minutes tearing up before I have to take it away.\\n-pool tables aren't crooked or ripped up felt.  All required balls are present and accounted for (it is amazing how many bars think two or three balls missing is acceptable)\\n-Bathroom is free of the typical \\\"lake of piss\\\" found under urinals or the crapper.  Also very little graffiti on the stalls.\\n-I don't think I have ever seen a dirty table here longer than 60 seconds.  Nicholas Cage can't even steal a car that fast.\\n-Patrons here seems to have a much lower douche bag ratio than most neighborhood bars.  Still there, just lower.\\n-They serve Pabst cheap (honestly I can't drink that ghetto piss but my Dad loves it and that is why he comes here)\\n-They have that awesome trivia shit on the TV's.\\n\\nBad points about this place:\\n\\n..............I'll edit this if I ever come across any.  Until then, this section stays blank.  \\n\\nKeep up the good work!"}

Wife had Lobster Ravioli, which we both gave a \\\"meh\\\".  Just not much flavor to it and the lobster wasn't strong enough to overcome the lack of anything else. My son liked his spaghetti and meatball. I tried the meatball and it was good, but way over-salted. My daughter had the chicken parmesan which was also pretty good and the size of an adult portion. For reference the chicken parm was at least twice the size of the spaghetti in case you have hungry kids.

When we did get in (maybe 12-15 minutes later), the popular food dishes were almost empty, and the few workers behind the counters were not in a hurry to make more available despite requests. The server brought first round of drinks rapidly but no straws then disappeared for 30-40 minutes (he later said he got a party of 25 in the next seating area).

I generally despise humid heat, so it seemed like an all-around bad idea.  However, I felt like the Groupon was a great deal, and I wanted to try a new experience.\\n\\nI was warmly welcomed when I first showed up for class, and they were very encouraging for my 11 year-old daughter to join for the 2nd half of class as well.  I was surprised by how \\\"accomplish-able\\\" the hot environment was, and the combination of good instructor dialogue and watching other students made me feel like I could keep up with no problem, even for the poses that I hadn't done before in other yoga forms.  Huge bonus for the instructors making a point to know everyone's name to call out corrections and praise during class.  The stress of using class as a moving meditation really makes this an individual practice in the midst of the community.  Great sense of energy every step of the way.\\n\\nI did 4 classes with 4 different instructors in the first week, and saw some students multiple times.  The sense of community at this studio is great.  Everyone is incredibly positive and welcoming.  I am definitely sticking with this studio, and the personal challenge of Bikram practice."}

When I arrived my wife and I met Alladin, shop owner, who seemed very confident. He said he worked with pro athletes and sounded like he knew what he was talking about. He tried selling me a suit and said it would be worth the money. Later I purchased an $800 Hugo Boss suit and came back to see him to have it altered. He made all of the necessary markings and pinned the back of the jacket to be altered. A week later I came with my wife to pick up the suit and he handed me the wrong suit (good thing I checked). He didn't ask me to try the right one on so I asked if I could make sure it fit. Long story short, he never altered the jacket and the pants seam was off. He tried to charge $200 for doing nothing to the jacket which is a scam. He finally agreed to fix the jacket so sent us to lunch and made some adjustments. He didn't know how to work with the modern Hugo Boss material and you could see the stitching marks from the hem on the outside of the pants legs . WHAT A JOKE! I was going to seek legal advice but figured I would spend more on a lawyer than just making the ruined suit work.

Basically read the whole menu to us when we said it was our first time. We had already had time to read the menu and we can read so that was about five minutes of our time she totally wasted. She then compared AG to Maestro's and Ruth Chris which was a huge mistake. I love Maestro's lobster mashed potatoes so when she made that comparison and I saw it on the menu I was like ok, this should be great. NOT. They were runny and EXTREMELY salty. The rub on the steak was also very salty. I think someone in the kitchen has a strong salt fetish and obviously no one is QC what is leaving the kitchen w/ a small taste test. I ordered the Sea Bass and the fish was in like a pyramid shape that made the fish about 3 inches tall and very thick. Obviously this type of uneven cut will affect the cooking. So I felt the inside was cooler and not as done as the thinner, outside parts and that made my stomach turn. Who cuts a fish like this? I have never seen that done. Then the lovely complimentary butter cake came for being our first time there. It's their \\\"signature\\\" dessert. BLAH, it did not impress me.

Fortunately, we found out that it tastes a lot better than it looks. The pizza was great with a rich sauce and I loved the meatballs. The crust on the other hand was hard, flavorless and crunchy like a dog biscuit. I felt like a five year old with all of the crusts piled up on my plate. Ironically my three year old loved them.\\n\\nLastly we tried a sample three dessert platter with chocolate cheesecake, New York cheesecake and a cannoli. The cheesecake wasn't anything special, but my whole family enjoyed the cannoli. \\n\\nThe total bill was high for the amount of food that we received...especially when considering the \\\"large\\\"pizza.

However 20min in a security guy came up and told us that the 2 guys who were with us (12 girls) who had just paid $100 each were not allowed to sit at our table...

After arguing with the man and demanding he at least tell us why we had to go - he told us an owners friend had bought out the table and he had to give it them 'or else he's lose his f******* job\\\" as though it was out fault. \\n\\nI know that this is not unusual in clubs, to be asked to leave a free table (given by promoters) when someone who can afford to buy it comes along- but the workers their were SO RUDE about it, as though we had snuck into the table and stole their alcohol.\\n\\nAfter leaving the table we went down into the crowd which was so crowded my friends and I were literally stuck in the same position for 10 min, absolutely unable to move, at the same time the bottle service attendants are shoving you from behind - I remember asking one of them, who was carrrying a large stack of cups to a table to \\\"not push me\\\" to which he responded he'll \\\"push me if he has to\\\" and then did. \\n\\nAnother friend was repeatedly yelled at and threatened to be kicked out because she was leaning against a surface close and kinda connected to the tables - her back was turned to the Dj and crowd and it was clear she just needed somewhere to sit for bit\\n\\nIn addition, water bottles (8oz fuji waters) were $8 dollars each, a redbull was $9 - As they made us get their 4 hours early because we \\\"had a table\\\" we all sobered up pretty fast - which meant you had to spend I cant imagine how much on drink from the bar.. which costs a lot!\\n\\nOverall, I would never go back here -  The club itself was definitely cool, but the workers there all seem to be on power highs from working in the \\\"hottest\\\" club in vegas, its just not worth it - I have been to Las Vegas multiple times and to a lot of different clubs but have never experienced such arrogant and pretentious servers and security. - they literally ruined our night\\n\\nI would recommend Surrender, XS, or any of other clubs!

I had it with the popular Hawaiian side dish, macaroni salad and then added a side of Korean Kim chee. The food is great and a break from all the normal college row food fare. Give it a try!"}

The shio was great and I thoroughly enjoyed every slurp of the noodles.  My wife opted for the miso butter corn ramen, a northern Japan specialty, which she liked a lot. \\n\\nBased on the Yelp buzz, it was a flat out guarantee to see a Yelper in the house.  Nice seeing My and Thao T with their little, future food connoisseur in tow!\\n\\nSolid ramen place but I felt like my meal was incomplete without a big bottle of Asahi Super Dry (no liquor license yet?) and good gyoza.  The gyoza was below average.  I definitely like this place over Monta.  My wife refuses to step into Anime due to the manga otaku factor so I can't compare that yet.

{"_id": 1, "text": "Let me start by saying I read the reviews PRIOR go going here.  Overprice - ehh, it's Vegas, and it's Gordon Ramsay, so what.   What was constant in other reviews was the service.  I thought, you know, worth a try, could be start up pains.  Well, WOW.  Very disappointed with the front of the house.  We had reservations, showed up early, and they were clearly confused looking up reservation on the computer and an iPad, so stand to the side.  A manager type (noted as a manager by not wearing the newsprint jumper mini dress all other hostess were wearing) asks \\\"may I help you\\\".  Tell her we were told to wait, she asks for name again, and then with an attitude, tells us, \\\"for 7:45\\\"  (it was 8:25 and we had an 8:30).  I reply 8:30, she walks away without saying a word.   Eventually we're seated, smack in the middle of the dining room that is visible from the casino, good table, near a POS/waiter station.   18 minutes later - yes, eighteen, the waiter comes by, politely greets us, asks about drinks, but we didn't have a drink menu.  He was trying his best, but good service is not solely the poor waiter's responsibility.    \\n\\nWhen we placed our drink order, we placed our entire order (app, 2 entrees).   Bread plates were provided, then breads were brought.  Breads were finished, so empty crock, tray and 2 small bowls for sauces remained on the table.  (did I mention the waiter station/lsland 6 feet from us).\\n\\nOur appetizer came, long plate, used our bread plates for serving plates.  Finished, and now all those plates were still at the table.  Our entrees came, after having been walked around to the dining room with the beer barrels (cause I saw the food go by me first, then come back).   Plates were set, we moved our bread plates to the side on top of the appetizer long tray - and there they remained.\\n\\nThe only redemption was the food was good.  My husband ordered Shepard's Pie, which I wish I would have ordered as it was very good.  I had fish and chips, which, one of my fish got soggy at the bottom, but another was crispy.  I read critiques that the chips weren't authentic - I liked them.  My guess if I had to replicate at home, is that you take 1 potato, make it a thick steak fry - so 1 potato = 1 fry; and they probably use the rest of the sides for the mash, but I liked them.\\n\\nThere was another manager type, male this time, (manager noted by his not wearing the punk suspender type clothes waiters were wearing) and this guy looked so sleazy .  Sweaty - seriously, like the kind Gordon rips to shred on Kitchen Nightmares.   I actually told my husband it looked like the KN in NY where this godfather type guy wore the trench coat and glasses and they owned a lobster house, and argued with Chef about \\\"maine lobsters\\\".  This guy seriously went to the table behind me, about 12 times.  And please, I'm not knocking appearance, I'm not a barbie type person, but I do expect people regardless of age or size, to look presentable, meaning, clothes fit properly, clothes are clean & neat.   Not sure what the couple did or who they were to warrant attention every 7 minutes, but obviously this clueless manager couldn't turn his back and see a stack of empty plates at our table while we were trying to finish our entrees!\\n\\nAlmost thru our meal, the waiter came buy, said could I take those plates, since you've been staring at them your entire meal.   Again, he was waiting every table in that dining room, and he was hustling, but no support!  At one point when we finished our meal, he ask someone when he saw us finish, to please bus our table - and he did, about 10 minutes later.\\n\\nNever did I think a pub meal would take 2+ hours.  Again, it's Vegas, so yes, it's over priced, but shamefully not worth it.  I won't be back.  The poor front of house isn't a testament to starting pains, it's poor execution and leadership.  I'll keep watching the damn shows though!"}

They were busy enough and they have many 'regular' visitors that are being treated as family. This enthusiasm was however not reserved for our group of 9. Our table (like the first time) was crammed and our number 9 seat was squeezed at the end. Service is on a familiar basis and a little too much on the miss side an lesser on the hit side. Granted our payable drinks were served promptly, but we had request jugs of water twice before they were actually served. \\nThe starter I took was the prosciutto and melon - the melon was tough. The prosciutto was very good. Main course was Spag Carbonara - to which I added mushrooms and that was made very well and good and creamy - I really enjoyed that! Once that was finished we waited - table cleared and.. waited. Until one of our group requested a dessert menu from a flyby waiter. no no no .. we should be offered not asked for! - I ordered a banasplit (as you don't get that very often these days) in my experience a banana split is vanilla ice cream, nuts, banana and chocolate sauce. - or if you will a dame blanche with banana. Anyhow.. we were served a very colourful plate of 3 different flavoured ice-creams (vanilla, strawberry, chocolate) - some green colouring and a variety of fruits that DO NOT BELONG in a banana split. I did not ask for figs, kiwis, pineapple nor green apple. This is NOT a fruit punch cocktail. Coffee was served but no cookie or chocolates.

They even fit my party of 4 in with no notice on a weekend evening (wow, right?) and the service was great.They didn't get that last star because I can't give them full credit - they said the food was \\\"very spicy\\\" when we got there, and it was barely a 1-2/10 on the spiciness scale. I understand that not everyone loves spice as much as I do, but you don't lead with that kind of promise and then disappoint. Oh well. I'll be back anyway, just will have to make sure to ask for extra spice. The black bean dip was great, the tofu cracklins were FAB, and the fish was all very very good.

Portions are larger than you'd expect even in the small plates for expensive ingredients like filet Mignon, lobster and foie gras. \\n\\nFood:\\nTypical of high scale restaurants you get some freebies. Among the breads the garlic is the best, my co-worker went through five slices! Another freebie are prawns which are imparted with a smoky flavor from the grill, excellent. We got foie gras for our appetizer. It was served with fresh herbs on a graham cracker like crust. Juicy and succulent I can see myself getting foie gras much more often after this one.  The beef wellington i had was cooked perfectly. The dough and duck fat that surrounded it could not have been better. After being so pleased with the app and entree i was underwhelmed by the desert. The dark chocolate souffl\\u00e9  came with a sauce that tasted like it had only a hint of dark chocolate. Not worth it for chocolate lovers.\\n\\nPrice: Although expensive these ingredients are usually twice the price at different restaurants.\\n\\nAmbiance: The whole hotel has the Frank Lloyd Wright feel which looks amazing although there is nothing special about this place when compared to the rest of the hotel.\\n\\nBottom Line: If you're staying at the Biltmore Hotel this place is your best bet for satisfaction."}

Another worthwhile spot would be RM Seafood, which is run by Top Chef Masters contestant Rick Moonen.\\n\\nAside from these two restaurants, there was not much in terms of stores.  And a lot of the stores were more gimmick stores.  One of the stores was a sock store, which reminds me of the one at CityWalk.

I like that they serve it with a side of rice since that's how I tend to eat it. We Filipinos do a similar soup called sinegang and we eat rice in it so if I can't make sinegang I go and order Tom Yum somewhere. \\n\\nThe ambiance is interesting with all the beautiful Thai wood carvings.

What is fun - the fact you can order and order and order - since you can get half roll (maki) you can really eat a lot of sushi and try everything.  Pay attention to the black board to the right of the sushi bar - with specials.  Salmon Belly was available one night - super fantastic.  Super White Tuna - fantastic. Salmon and Hamachi really good.  Scallop - good. Conch, Halibut and Sweet Shrimp - were just OK.  Lots of desserts included. Sea Weed Salad, things other than sushi are included but you order with your waiter and not the sushi chefs.  Sit at the sushi counter - fun and they just wait on you attentively - asking you what you like and giving you whatever you want.   Spicy Tuna crackers everyone raves about - didn't seem that special. Everyone raves about the Pork Belly - was OK.  But hey - its included so try it.  Service is good.  Sitting at the Sushi Bar - much better because you have the sushi guy right there asking you what you want all the time.

Here the red is better than the green.  And the roasted serranos are nicely spicy. \\nThe guacamole order comes with chips.  Not home made but tasty.

I also had the calamari served with a spicy remoulade sauce and had my steak with an excellent blue cheese salad & steamed mixed veg.\\n\\nNo room for dessert but marking this one down for another visit."}

On vacation with my wife in September (2012), we went to Jaleo and had our minds blown!! This place is pricey, but worth it.The whole experience was amazing - the food, the service, the big open kitchen, the drinks - I can't wait to go back. Highest quality ingredients and cooked in a very unique way. Both of us are thinking we'll have to go at least 2 or 3 more times to try all the amazing dishes we saw on the menu."}
{"_id": 3, "text": "The food the Sports Deli does best on are the finger foods and sandwiches.  The buffalo wings we just ordered were spot on.  As good as any wings I've had.  My preference is to get the wings dry with the sauce on the side, that way the wings will stay crispy longer.  We also got the #8 Silver State (beef, pastrami, brisket, swiss) which was pretty good.  It kind of reminded me of NYC deli's...yeah, that good!  Next time though I'm going to grab a bite of the #7 Boulder City (pastrami, fried egg, bacon, cheddar)...a recipe to clog my arteries even more.  You're going down #7!...inside my stomach, that is, next time I'm near the Sports Deli.\\n\\nThe pizzas and burgers are just OK.  Not worth an attempt in my opinion, but then it again it's not my appetite or stomach.  To each his own!  But I'll stick to the sandwiches and finger foods."}
{"_id": 1, "text": "Mandalay Bay used to be one of my favorite Vegas places, today I find myself wishing 'if only the shiny veneer went a bit deeper'. The check in process was ridiculously long on a Wednesday afternoon, the maid service was utterly dismal (left dirty glasses all over the room), the sink in the room kept backing up, and our bill was wrong at checkout (spurring the process to almost 25 minutes). If your still reading it's worth saying that when I'm on vacation, I am not staying in a bargain basement 'super special rack rate' room which is what made this all the more a bitter pill to swallow. Hopefully they will pull it together again soon, but it's Vegas and those that fall behind soon find the wrecking ball."}

On several occasions they have done little or nothing to accommodate him during such instances....stating that they are booked and that I should visit an emergency vet. Well then why am I paying you monthly if you can never see my pet when he needs to be seen? I was told \\\"you do know this is a wellness clinic?\\\" So, apparently sick pets are not a priority for them. The Desert Ridge location is FAR better about getting him in...even when they are full, they squeeze him in between patients. It is a shame, because I really like Dr. Cherico. Furthermore, the techs are not very skilled in handling feisty pets. My other cat does not like coming to the vet, at all, and often becomes very agitated. One instance the techs left me in the room for 20 minutes to try and get my hissing, spitting, and scratching cat in her crate by myself. During a subsequent teeth cleaning she was allowed to scratch herself in her own eye leading to an eye infection that became an ear infection as well. It was awful.

{"_id": 3, "text": "The best thing about the Excalibur is that it's more economical than other hotels on the strip. The cost of the hotel room was $27 (booked through Expedia). Of course, with all the vegas hotels these days, resort fee of $15 which gets you amenities, including wired internet in your room. The deal also included $20 food and beverage credit, which can be used at mostly bars, and the one restaurant I saw on there, which was the steakhouse (which is on the pricier side. Look up my review of the steak house at camelot for more info on the coupon there). Also included was a free play at the Dungeon, aka the midway arcade. The coupon book didn't include any match plays, unfortunately.\\n\\nThe room itself was nice. Spacious enough. The tv is large. There is an ethernet cable for you to plug into your computer for wired internet service. The internet was a bit slow. \\n\\nThe beds were fine. They give you 3 pillows, so you get some extra fluff. \\n\\nThe elevators were separated floors 1-18 and 18 and up. So if you want a fast elevator service and a high floor, book Floor 18 or so. \\n\\nAs for the casino, it was stingy. Many of the blackjack tables use continuous shuffler machines, which I am not a fan of. Most minimums were around $10 for most table games."}

I have had the Southern Fried chicken salad and the Blackened Chicken Salad, both were good.  The avacado on Blackened Chicken salad was too ripe (brown spots and stuff) - it was a little weird.  But my friend had the special last week and it was fantastic and cheap.  It was $7.95 for a fantastic chicken breast over unreal 'smashed potatoes'.  My friend Tuesday got the wrap special which he said was excellent but in the description the waitress neglected to tell him there was bacon on the wrap and he is Muslim so we had to pick it out but other than that he said it was awesome.  The fries that came with the wrap are also VERY good.  So I will keep going here and may even try it for a work breakfast!!"}
{"_id": 0, "text": "I was here this past Saturday (10/5) at around 1:00pm.\\n\\nEvery time I go to Vegas I love to get Pina Coladas from the various hotel bars to compare. I was gambling at the Stratosphere so I decided to stop here to give their pina coladas a try.  \\n\\nThere were two bartenders on duty. One older guy and one younger guy. Both were horrible! First of all, they were totally uninterested in the bar and its customers. They seemed to only be interested in each other and huddling up to talk to each other on the other side of the bar where nobody was sitting.\\n\\nPeople, such as myself, would come up to order a drink and they never checked on customers or anything. I stood there for close to 10 minutes before this guy who had been at the bar with his girlfriend for a while drinking and playing games, whistled to get the younger guy's attention to come serve me.\\n\\nHe finally comes over there and walked over to them and said, \\\"What do you need?\\\" They said, \\\"Dude we don't need anything, but you have a customer that has been standing here for the longest time waiting to be served.\\\" So he looked over at me and hesitantly walked up. He still didn't say anything. He didn't greet me or say, \\\"Can I get you something?\\\" NOTHING! He just stood there with this blank look on his face like he couldn't IMAGINE what I might want from him??!!\\n\\nSo I said, \\\"Um, I would like to order drinks\\\". And he said, \\\"Oh...drinks?\\\" AS IF this was news to him that someone would come up to a damn bar to order DRINKS??!!  So I ordered my drinks for myself and the person I was with. So he made the drinks and never ONCE made eye contact or exerted any sort of true customer service. He just rang me up.\\n\\nThe damn pina colada was $9.75 and it was below mediocre. argh  I went ahead and tipped him because if I didn't, I know his lame ass would have probably blamed it on me being black and NOT on the fact that he's a lousy bartender that gave shitty, dismissive service!\\n\\nOn top of that, while I was standing there waiting for my drinks to be made, the older guy argued with this couple about the amount they charged them for their drinks. They were arguing that because they were playing video poker (or whatever game it was up there) that they shouldn't be charged full price for their drinks. They were saying that they were staying at the hotel and the night before they paid less than $9 for the same drinks BECAUSE they were playing video poker. But on that day, this older guy was charging them $12 for their drinks.\\n\\nThe older guy was very gruff in his tone when telling them there was NO WAY they could have paid anything below $9.75 for their drinks. So he was basically calling them liars. When they tried to appeal to the younger guy, he was confused as hell. In one breath he was telling them they charge less if you're playing games at the bar...and in the next breath he was telling them they had to pay full price for their drinks? They were pissed.\\n\\nAnyway, the bartender that I had to deal with was named Ben. Steer clear of his clueless, non customer service having ass! I don't know what their deal was that day but they pissed me off. All I wanted was a pina colada and instead I was treated like I was a nuisance to them! So weird!"}

On another visit, I tried the fried fish, and I don't think I could have been more disappointed.  It was seriously a fish with only half the meat left on it (bizarre wedges were cut out of it, and filled with limes), stuck in a fryer, un-filleted (other than the wedges), and essentially undressed or prepared (other than the limes).  The decor is juvenile (one sign said sexual harassment will not be reported but graded), and unappealing to say the least.  Bad price, sub-par food, but ok service."}

{"_id": 2, "text": "The lobby and the hotel is beautifully done. However, the Palazzo is a new property and the rooms are already starting to show signs of wear and tear. At first glance, our suite was beautiful. Then I started noticing little things that bothered me. \\n\\nIn my opinion, their housekeeping service was pretty sloppy. When we arrived in our room, there was still trash in the trash bins from the previous guest. OK - so I could overlook that. But when I went to the bathroom, my heart sank. I saw mildew in the shower. And not just a little. When it comes to hotels, my biggest pet peeve is a bathroom that has mildew in the shower or bathtub. Seriously, what's the deal here? Each room is supposedly cleaned every day - when you clean a bathroom every day, there really should not be any mildew problem. This is the second 5 star hotel in Las Vegas (the first one was the Bellagio) that had this problem. We've stayed at lesser starred hotels such as the Hilton, where we stayed in a timeshare double suite that did NOT have daily maid service. We did not have a mildew issue there. \\n\\nOn a positive note, housekeeping was very accommodating when I asked for extra towels or extra toiletries. Unfortunately, their issue is trying to save some money on Tilex. I'm not one to complain about my room while I'm staying at a hotel. I'm scared that the person I have complained about will spit on my toothbrush or use it as a toilet brush. I'd rather yelp the hotel once I've left and then share my experience with others. \\n\\nHubby told me I was being too critical and that the hotel is starting to get run down because they are constantly packed and have a high turn over of guests. He played the devil's advocate until he saw some nasty splatters on the wall next to the sink. Looks like someone had partied too hard and missed the sink. It even grossed him out. \\n\\nAnother gripe I have was service related. Many workers seemed to be cordial and even cold - not warm and friendly. There wasn't any meaning behind their questions on how things were going or how we enjoyed our stay. There wasn't any inquiry on why I told someone that our stay at the hotel was \\\"just OK\\\". So I think they ask the questions and really could care less how we felt about our stay. Which suits me fine because there are a lot of other hotels in Vegas who would welcome us and care about our stay in their hotel. \\n\\nThe rooms are equipped with a printer so that you can work and even print out your boarding tickets. Unfortunately, our printer was broken, so I had to waste a good hour of gambling time waiting for the on call IT attendant to come upstairs and fix the printer. \\n\\nWhen I asked the valet/bus attendant on the phone about holding our luggage for a few minutes while we checked out and basically asking if it were the same person who would be obtaining our luggage and then bringing it out - he sounded peeved that I would even ask the question - assuming that I'd know that it would be two different people - so that I'd obviously have to tip both of them. \\n\\nI would have left less than 3 stars, but the hotel does have some strong points. The lobby and the water and floral displays are beautiful. It's location is centrally located and attached to the Venetian, it's older sister. The hotel's spa - Canyon Ranch is amazing. Also, there are excellent restaurants in the Palazzo and the Venetian. If you didn't want to leave the hotel, you'd have everything at your fingertips. There's even a Walgreens just outside the hotel. \\n\\nThe casino is small, so we ended up playing at the Venetian, Bellagio or the Wynn. There is a small non-smoking section, but I didn't see anyone policing the person who was gambling and puffing away in the area. \\n\\nI'm not sure I'll ever give the Palazzo a second chance - because I really, really wanted to love it there. Unfortunately, our first date was a flop - so I'm really not sure about a second date."}

I had stayed at the MGM years ago as a kid and expected the rooms to be outdated, but on the contrary the rooms, gaming floors, and restaurants were very contemporary and exceeded expectations. \\n\\nMGM has a large pool facility including a lazy river for only guests to use. The pools are  adjacent to the Wet Republic Day Club and while I was using the pool, Steve Aoki was at Wet Republic spinning away. The music could be heard but at a distant level, providing background music to to the area. Once I got up to leave, I walked around the facility which was when I discovered the lazy river.

My bf and I were both on the guestlist but were told that we had to be at the venue by 10PM when the club opens at 10:30PM.

After arriving at around 1:30AM, there was no line at the door and we were in within 2 minutes. The club and decor is pretty standard, the sound system was average, but definitely still a great time. \\n\\nMGM also has a large gaming space comparatively to newer hotels, which is perhaps one of the aspects to how they maintain their competitive advantage. With a wide variety of gaming tables and slots, I would not hesitate to recommend this place to a friend who enjoyed a good round of blackjack or craps.\\n\\nThe only con about this hotel is that the location is a bit further from the center of the strip and would require more walking which I am normally fine with.

I'm telling you, as beautiful as this hotel is they do not hire friendly, happy nice people!! check this out.. they have cocktail waitresses walking around and after gambling and feeling thirsty (since they did not come to our area) i went to the bar and asked for a bottle of water. the waitress had an attitude and was rude and gave me a small bottle reluctantly. i asked for another bottle for my husband and she had the nerve to tell that she cannot because they are $2 a bottle!! what the hell!! i said we are staying here & my husband is right over there and would like some water..she decided to give me another little tiny bottle and then decided to talk about me to the other waitress that was standing by her... rude, rude, rude.. then later on that night i went to one of the little shops to buy some ice cream and the nasty person behind the counter huffed 'I'm closed\\\" turned off the light and turned her back on me! yo!! I'm tripping out at this point.. i cannot believe such rude service for such a beautiful high end hotel.. so i called front dest & asked to speak to a manager and I explained the 2 situations.. she apologized and said that she will 'comp\\\" our breakfast the next day... My husband and I had breakfast next morning and when we went to check out...what happened?? Yep.. they charged us for breakfast instead of \\\"comping\\\" as they had said. I had to explain to the front desk person that i spoke with a supervisor (Tiffany) and she said to charge breakfast to our room and it will be comp! she had a attitude but decided to remove it off my bill... there were more rude situations.. but all i have to say is this.. while this is a beautiful hotel/resort with beautiful comfortable rooms and many amenities and our maid was good as she did clean our room and left it beautiful.. but overall customer service SUCKS!!!!! this hotel does not hire friendly or nice people.. therefore i refuse to stay at this hotel again!!!!"}

Added benefit is the phenomenal patio -- one of the best bar patios in town for sure. I've been there twice in the past week to watch Suns playoff games. Food is very good for bar food. First night was just 5-6 shared appetizers (wings, potato skins, chicken quesadilla, etc. - you know the stuff for us health nuts). Everything was fantastic. The second night we had the prime rib, mashed potatoes and asparagus dinner. Only $12 and it was great. After we had the skillet cookie which was one of the best things I've ever tasted -- I will get that every time I go no matter what. ;-) The only drawback was the wait staff. Was hard to get a drink a few times. Other than that, fantastic experience and we will be back regularly."}

It has to be good right?\\\"  Boy, were we wrong!  The albacore was icy?  WTF?  The tuna was fishy.  AND.  AND!  The toro was so fibrousy.\\n2.

Fast Fix stepped up to the challenge for $20. After a specialty designed ring removal tool failed to cut through the stainless steel ring, they took me in back with their master craftsman ( I think his name was Antonio) and had him use an air powered ryobi-like tool to cut it off. He made a shield to protect my finger then spent 20 minutes diligently working his way through the sturdy metal. I really appreciate this as the ring was starting to dig into my hand and started causing real problems - If Fast Fix hadn't stepped in I might have needed to go to the ER to get it removed (likely more than twenty minutes and $20). BTW $20 for a watch battery installed or $10 to remove a watch link is fair when you consider mall rent - your simply paying a premium for convenience."}

A sandwich I had 4-6 years ago, tastes as good today as it did back then. \\n \\nThe Bad: \\nIt's not really bad, but to best honest, I think its time for a little make over.  It's one thing to be consistent but this restaurant needs to catch up with its competition.  There are many many new restaurants in the valley, especially in the Scottsdale area and to the locals this can get boring.

The childcare staff here is dull and not at all personable. My son normally loves going to the childcare because he gets to play with kids but from the moment we got there he was upset.

And hotels such as Red Rock will find that with such lack of concern where they cannot be bothered with potential health concerns, us folks, who are not in our 20s blooming with health, will not be willing to patronize them.\\n-- Frankly, if it wasn't for the fact that we were at the hotel due to a convention and prepaid by the hosting company, we would have left and gone to a much better hotel on the Strip.\\n-- Lastly, the enclosed shower smelled AWFUL like an open sewer. Clearly the drain needed cleaning out. It smelled like something died in there. During showers we had to breath through our mouths; it made you gag if you breathed through your nose. Given the total lack of response from their engineer to the prior request, we didn't see the point in trying to get it rectified.\\n-- To add insult to injury, for some reason during our last day there (was there 3 nights), housekeeping failed to clean our room whatsoever. It figures....."}

Their tater tots are some of the best in town too!  I had a bad experience with trivia there once (the hostess told us we were not allowed to cheer and that we needed to be quiet, cause she gets annoyed by loud noises...REALLY?!?!?  I think they fired her).  They have a few ski ball games and I once stopped in on \\\"League Night\\\" and ended up playing for a while in a legue for free...still not sure how that happened.  Oh...and beer in a mason jar, gotta love that!"}

If I knew it was going to take this long I would of never ordered anything to eat. I doubt I would have mind if I came in here with someone but I just got off work."}

Specials were related and all questions answered.\\n\\nFood served in a timely fashion and it was delicious.   House wine was good and a great value.   My beer snob friends approved of the beer selections and prices.\\n\\nService seems to be better than most restaurants.   I will be back frequently."}
{"_id": 3, "text": "For a long time, I avoided Qdoba. Really! I always had this idea that the food here was awful, greasy, and just all around bad for me. Well, I was mostly right, but it turns out that Qdoba is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be! In fact, I could easily see it becoming a fantastic occasional treat in my life.\\n\\nI stopped in and ordered a quesadilla to go and couldn't have been happier. The pulled pork was delicious and I was able to get extra salsa, guacamole and sour cream in little cups on the side, meaning that my main entree wasn't completely slathered in distracting toppings. And I was SO impressed with the staff and assembly line they had going. Despite coming in to find a long dinner line, I was in and out within minutes. Very nice!\\n\\nI didn't stay to eat here because the layout in the dining area seemed pretty cramped, although I noticed as I was getting ready to leave that there was an upstairs. Any place in Oakland is bound to have space issues sometimes just because of the student lunch/dinner rush. But the layout here did nothing to help the matter; while the staff were able to keep the line moving, there was almost no room to actually accommodate the long line that began forming and snaking through the tiny building. \\n\\nStill, the food was pretty excellent, even if I had to go elsewhere to get some elbow room while I devoured it. For the record, comparing Qdoba and Chipotle seems pretty apples and oranges given that their menus are only a little similar. So sure, the food is better at Chipotle, but the options aren't NEARLY as diverse. Apples and oranges. A better comparison is Qdoba and Taco Bell, and in that sense Qdoba is truly superior. I mean really, who thinks it's even a contest?\\n\\nUnfortunately there were no reasonably healthy options here, so I doubt I'm going to be able to become a regular. Once I work off the quesadilla in about a month I'd love to eventually come back and see if the tacos compare - although I admit, when it comes to burritos I do think I'll forever be a Chipotle fan."}

All I have to say it is always a great experience.  I've been to a few stadium across the country and the Cardinals  have one of the better stadiums I've visited.  The Cardinals stadium has  comfortable seating, awesome views from anywhere, spacious walkways, lots and lots of amenities  (food, washrooms and a fan shop) and more then enough parking for tailgating.\\n\\nRemember to get to the stadium early  before a game, so you can take advantage of all the great restaurants.  Don't forget statium personnel screen everyone coming in, and are strict with the NFL's new bag policies (ladies- get a wristlet or buy one of the clear tote bags).\\n\\nSo if you get a chance head to the stadium to check it out."}

The patron two cars in front of me apparently thought she was ordering at a fine dining establishment.  It's Wendys not a fancy steakhouse.

I took my own advice and did the same.  Will not be back to this location."}

They brag that they are the best burger in Charlotte and I have to say I am having trouble finding a better one.  \\n\\nLiberty is located right on South Blvd in Southend right near Pewter Rose.  Parking is a little tight depending on the night.\\n\\nThe Carolina burger is my favorite here!  Everything from the bun to the toppings to the size of the whole thing is totally up my alley!  I had to smoosh mine a bit and cut it in half to eat it because it was so big.  All of the ingredients were super fresh and made a great combination.  \\n\\nThe only downside I have to the place is the fries.  Everyone likes different kinds of fries - I like the traditional type, sorry to say like McDonalds-ish.  Not too big and just the right amount of salty.  The fries at Liberty are gourmet or something - seasoned to the hilt and mucho pungent.  It isn't my preference but I know some folks love this kind.\\n\\nWe have never had a bad experience with service here - everyone is super friendly and accommodating.  The bar area has booths and high tops but there is also a proper restaurant.  The decor is very warm and cozy with great art work and gorgeous chandeliers.  Check out the one above you when you first walk in!  You will be craving some suds!  :-D"}

{"_id": 1, "text": "First, before I delve into this review, I'm a huge fan of and am sure to tell other people of Burgatory.  Which is why it is so hard to write this review.\\n\\nThis was not my first visit here, it was my second.  The first visit I made here ended up with me turning right around and walking away.  It was so crowded (on a Tuesday night) that I just didn't even want to deal with the crowd.  Funny thing is with this new location, instead of expanding it in any direction, it's still the same size as when the other restaurants that failed in this spot.\\n\\nNow onto my most recent visit.  We showed up and there was a bit of a wait.  After giving our name to the hostess, we ventured over to the bar.  While at the bar, we decided to sit at the bar and have our experience of the place instead of sitting at a table (had to go back to the hostess to have our name removed from the wait list).  We both ordered some drinks, a fairly decent list of IPAs on draft and we put in for an appetizer.  The truffled Gorgonzola fries were pretty amazing.  When we ordered the burgers, that's when it went downhill for me.\\n\\nI opted for the make your own burger.  After scribbling and rewriting we had our orders down.  Handed them over to the bartender and just had to wait.  I had ordered my burger topless (just the bottom of the bun).  When the burger arrived everything that my eyes could see at the time looked perfect.  Whenever I cut into this delicious display of beefiness, that when I got to see what was underneath.  The bun was soggy, not the type of soggy that you get from the juices of the burger, or the wetness of the fresh vegetables, but soggy in the pink kind of way.  I was a little concerned about this and informed the bartender I would not be eating this.  While I give him credit for trying to explain to me that the pinkness to my bun was just the juices running of the burger patty, I had to disagree with him.  Mind you, I ordered my burger cooked to medium well, if there were any juices from the burger they sure as hell would not be pink.  There was no smell to it either, so it could not have been a dressing for a salad.\\n\\nAfter a trip to the kitchen the bartender came back out to me and said that the cook said that's how they cook.  I'm sorry, but that doesn't make me want to eat the burger any more than the fact that I can see with my own eyes that the bun portion was pink.\\n\\nIn the end, they offered to make me another burger (I assumed it would have been free, but wasn't).  I opted to have it to go, good thing I did, by the time all this was over and the burger was ready my friend had finished her meal.  The manager came over as well and apologized to me for the mistake made and after handing me my bag with my new burger in it, she also handed a coupon thing for a free milkshake the next time I visit (thanks a million for that, giving me a coupon for something free that I cannot not use because of a food related allergy).\\n\\nTo sum it all up, even though this place is literally like ten minutes from my house, I'll stick to the original spot and not take my chances again."}
{"_id": 3, "text": "I decided to go after reading all of the reviews and because I live really close and decided to check it out. I was disappointed with the service, it took us about fifteen minutes + to get a drink. It was probably because there was only one waiter working and the place was very busy. I was surprised how busy it was for a Wednesday, but not too surprised after I was actually able to order and eat the food. We ordered the sun roll, phoenix roll and caterpillar roll. The rolls were small, but good. Out of the three rolls we ordered, the sun roll was my favorite. The food is great, but the service is slow."}
{"_id": 0, "text": "My experience with BuddyV was terrible. I ordered house salad and the house special of shrimps with fettuccine. I told the waiter that I cannot have any bacon or pork products (due to religious reason); he understood but didn't care to mention that the salad has bruschetta on it. Well when the salad came I raised concerns and was told another salad is coming without meat.. but after ten minutes and rest of my party already had their salad finished; my salad never came. Later the manager came asking the same questions and promising another salad; to which I told him no since I didn't want start on salad while my party is on their main entr\\u00e9e'. I was hoping the food would be good, but no.. The pasta was not fully cooked, hard to chew, dry and only 3 shrimps!!! For a $30 entr\\u00e9e' I was expecting some good.  But no! This place is over rated; like many other things in Vegas."}

The menu is varied, and there is plenty to choose from whether you're vegetarian (i.e. Japanese Eggplant sandwhich, which I wish I had ordered) or a meat lover (i.e. burger with brie and portobello, which is what my colleague ordered).  \\n\\nI asked the waitress for her recommendation between the tuna melt and the Japanese eggplant sandwhich.  I know, 2 very different sandwiches, but I couldn't decide.  She said they're both delicious but that \\\"people come here for our tuna\\\".  Sold.\\n\\nWell, the tuna was good, but I wouldn't say that I have to \\\"go there for their tuna\\\".  It had a different flavor, I'm guessing rosemary, and also had chestnuts in it to add crunch (not a huge fan honestly).  The wich came with a side of fries, which were decent.\\n\\nAll in all I was a bit disappointed, and wish I had ordered the Japanese eggplant sandwhich.\\n\\nI may have to return just to try it."}

There was litter on the floors and no one picked it up throughout the lunch period, but other than that it was just fine.   If I lived in Vegas, I would go back and explore the menu a bit more and then I would adjust my review accordingly.\\n\\nOverall, I would recommend this place to anyone who likes Thai food...btw:  Their Hottest setting is not really very hot."}

Be generous and give them tip for their Beer Fund! \\n\\nI've enjoyed the Bobbie and the Slaw Be Jo, (the philly is too spicy for me), but i still love their Capistrami the best.

They get an extra star just for the location. And the burger I ordered was awesome- probably the second or third best I've had in the Valley at this price point ($10 ish for a burger with fries). Hubs had brisket that they were smoking out back and it had a nice little kick to it.\\nWe also ordered the meat and cheese platter, which was all right but nothing special. They had to bring the listed olives separately because they forgot them on the platter. I also saw a table nearby sending back food because it wasn't what they had ordered (issue with getting a side dish right I think). Service was friendly but a bit slow and disorganized. Hopefully they get that together soon because this could be a great West Valley staple. I also wonder if they will do something to integrate with the community theater that is right next door. Dinner and a show could be a fantastic deal there."}
